The Cisco ESA Extras Add-on for Splunk Enterprise allows a SplunkÂ® Enterprise administrator to extract and filter event information from Cisco Ironport ESA appliances. The Add-on requires the official Splunk Add-on for Cisco ESA already configured according to Splunk Enterprise Documentation. This Add-on provides extra functionality such AS transactioning events for the Email and Malware data models for CIM compliance.
The Add-on requires customization on your Cisco ESA Ironport Appliance.

This add-on has two functions: 

1. Parses a custom log entry from ESA generated for every attachment and makes it CIM compliant for the Malware data model
2. Runs a saved search that creates a transaction of e-mail logs and AMP logs making them it CIM compliant for the E-mail AND Malware data model (if AMP Malware is detected)


This Add-on was sponsored by a client.
