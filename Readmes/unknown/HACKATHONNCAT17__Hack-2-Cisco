# Hack #2
The repository contains the problem statement for Hack #2 provided by Cisco.

## Problem Statement

Create a tool/app to do a "smart" security scan of a network router/access point that a user's device is attached to.

## Background:

Most home users seem to have almost no idea about how secure their home networks are, who might be trying to hack them, etc.  Many users don't really understand how vulnerable their home networks might be.

The app could do a few things. The first would be to learn how to connect to some standard home networking devices and download log files, scan them for possible problems. It could also check for common problems like missing or default passwords, etc.  Ideally it would run in the background and run periodically when connected to a known/home network, scan for issues, and display alert notifications if a problem is found.  It should be possible to get some basic functionality in place and have ability to add more as time permits or later even outside the hackathon. 

## Scoring Rubric:

### Innovativeness:

- How innovative is the idea and will it have a competitive advantage for Cisco?

### Value Proposition:

- How high is the potential value (productivity or new revenue)?

### Prototype:
- Does the solution feature a working prototype or proof-of-concept application? 

### Longevity:
- How likely is it to be further developed into a product or capability roadmap?

### Quality:

- Is the solution elegant and of high quality?
