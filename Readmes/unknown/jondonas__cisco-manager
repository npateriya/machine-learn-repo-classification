# Donas-tech

Jonathan's first repository and git project (you're looking at where it all began, folks)

This repo was made for experimenting with ciscoconfparse, a tool that parses an IOS devices configuration file and allows you to make changes to a cisco ios device over ssh. Fabric was used to initiate the ssh connection.
