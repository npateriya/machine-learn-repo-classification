# Compiling the dev environment
1. Install `electron` globally
2. Clone repo
## Without test server (recommended)
3. Change IP address to desired telnet target in `client/js/client.js`
4. `cd` to client folder and type `electron` **(If you have vscode, just open the repo  and press `crtl+shift+b`)**
## With test server (not recommended)
3. Change IP address to `127.0.0.1` in `client/js/client.js`
4. `cd` to client folder and run `electron` **(If you have vscode, just open the repo  and press `crtl+shift+b`)**

*Using the test server is not recommended and should only be used if you have absolutely nothing else to telnet to. All the server does is echo back whatever you send it.*
