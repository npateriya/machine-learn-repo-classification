## Envrionment Setup

I'm currently using Centos 7, with qemu-kvm and openvswitch. For openvswitch, I'm using the RDO repo, which you can find at
http://openstack.redhat.com. 

After I've installed the qemu / libvirt packages, I create a symbolic link:

```
ln -s /usr/libexec/qemu-kvm /usr/bin/qemu-kvm
```

For OVS, at the very least, you need to create two bridges.

```
ovs-vsctl add-br ovs-br0 -- set Bridge ovs-br0 stp_enable=true
ovs-vsctl add-br ovs-br1 -- set Bridge ovs-br1 stp_enable=true
```

I have some pre-created ifup scripts for ovs. Move them into place.

``` 
cp ~/netlab-scripts/templates/ovs-scripts/ovs{0,1}-ifup /usr/local/sbin/
```

I'm currently also using VXLAN and OpenFlow support with pretty good success.
