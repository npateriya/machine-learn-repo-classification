# c3_flask
Cisco Cloud Center (CliQr, C3) - Python Flask Service files

Currently in it's infancy.  

Use install.sh to "Deploy" the custom "Service".
Use flask.sh to "Start", "Stop", "Restart" from the service.

Or just us these files as a template to build your own "Service" in C3.

A very big thank you to FHD for the Ubuntu startup script (wow, what a life saver):  https://github.com/fhd/init-script-template
