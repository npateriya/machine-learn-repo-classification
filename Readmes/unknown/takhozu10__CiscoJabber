Cisco Jabber for Mac configuration file.
========================================
jabberLocalConfig.xml - File contains pre-determined CUCM server with server type selected for Cisco Jabber.
jabberConfig.sh - Shell script to extract current user name and append into xml file to customize the configuration with user specific information.

Removed company specific domain names from the file. Will need to replace <company.com> with company specific domain name.
