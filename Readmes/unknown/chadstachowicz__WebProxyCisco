WebProxyCisco
=============

Unity Connection API from the cloud using Homemade Java HTTP Server.  HTTP Server is the Java app that runs on the users desktop in order to go JSONP xml calls to it.

This technique ie necessary in combination with JSONP in order to actually provide a cloud 
service ajax accessability to internal LAN equipment in an enterprise such as Unity.  This would be installed on each
End users desktop that accessed said cloud service provider

USAGE

1. sift through source code and replace with your unity information.

2. compile with javac HttpRequest.java

3. java HttpRequest to run it

4. hit http://<localip>:10080/ and watch your return from Cisco Unity connection in the web browser.


5. Hook this up to some ajax with jsonp and be amazed at the things that are no possible.


Future

Will make it more frienly on settings, also an example rails app for people to see usage.
