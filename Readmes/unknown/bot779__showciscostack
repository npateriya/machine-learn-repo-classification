# showciscostack
Show the status of StackWise ports and the "health" of cisco switch stacks

This command works for cisco 3750 and 2960 stacks
(probably also for 3850 and anything using StackWise interfaces)

Usage:  
  ./showciscostack "[OPTIONS] [\<switch-IP\>]"  
  OPTIONS:  
  "--help -? -h"  
  "--showoid ;# show ifOperStatus OIDs instead of querying them"  
  "--community <community> ;# use the specified community string"
