# test-nxos

Playbooks for testing Ansible modules with Cisco NXOS devices

```
$ ansible-playbook all.yaml
```

To filter a set of test cases set limit_to to the name of the group (i.e. command, section, nxapi, etc.): 

```
$ ansible-playbook all.yaml -e"limit_to=nxapi"
```

To filter a singular test case set the tags options to nxapi or cli, set limit_to to the test group,
and test_cases to the name of the test:  

```
$ ansible-playbook all.yaml --tags="cli" -e"limit_to=nxapi test_case=return"
```

## Contributing Test Cases 

Test cases are added to roles based on the module being testing. Test cases
should include both `cli` and `nxapi` test cases. Cli test cases should be
added to role/tests/cli and nxapi tests should be added to
role/tests/nxapi.

### Conventions

- Each test case should generally follow the pattern:

  >setup —> test —> assert —> test again (idempotent) —> assert —> done

  This keeps test playbooks from becoming monolithic and difficult to
  troubleshoot.

- Include a name for each task that is not an assertion. (It's OK to add names
  to assertsion too. But to make it easy to identify the broken task within a failed
  test, at least provide a helpful name for each task.)
