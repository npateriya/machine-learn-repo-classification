virl-packet
===========

 
Tools for working with and automating [VIRL PE](http://virl.cisco.com/) deployments on [Packet](http://packet.net/).  
 
These scripts are not required if you simply want to run VIRL PE on a server hosted by http://packet.net/.  In that case, see https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/virlfaq/virlOnPacket and http://get.virl.info/packet.php.

Note that nothing here should be considered production-hardened unless you do the hardening for your purposes and environment.  For example - the use of passwords and / or tokens on the command-line are inherently unsecure, and exception-handling should be made robust per your potential inputs and scenarios.

If you have suggestions on existing scripts or want to include your own please send us pull requests.
