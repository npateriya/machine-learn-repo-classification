- None

#### Performance benchmarks

No performance tests have been performed, but the app has proved to perform well with the Splunk reference hardware running Splunk version 6.2 on daily data volumes of up to 200 GB in distributed environments, but will most likely work in larger distributed environments.

##### Support and resources

**This app is community supported on a best effort basis. In case you have needs for professional support billed by the hour, please contact the author.

## USER GUIDE

### Key concepts for Cisco Networks

The Splunk Admin must know how to configure data inputs and how Splunk stores and searches data in different indexes and how roles apply to what indexes are searched. 


### Data types

This app provides search-time knowledge for the following types of data from Cisco IOS variants, NX-OS and WLC:

**Search-time**

- cisco:ios - Syslog events from your devices
- Cisco:SmartCallHome - Inventory data from your devices


These data types support the following Common Information Model data models:


| Source Type | CIM Data Models |
| --- | --- |
| cisco:ios | Change Analysis<br/>Authentication<br/>Network Traffic<br/>|
| Cisco:SmartCallHome | Inventory|

### Lookups

The Cisco Networks app contains 3 lookup files.

**cisco_ios_facility_categories.csv**

Provides the vendor's description of an event category based on the event's facility.

- File location: lookups/cisco_ios_facility_categories.csv
- Lookup fields: facility, vendor_category
- Lookup contents: See the file contents

**cisco_ios_messages.csv**

Provides the vendor's recommended actions, explanations and message texts based on the event's facility, severity_id and mnemonic,

- File location: lookups/cisco_ios_messages.csv
- Lookup fields: facility, severity_id, mnemonic, vendor_message_text, vendor_explanation, vendor_recommended_action
- Lookup contents: See the file contents

**cisco_ios_variable_representations.csv**

Not yet in use, but may be used to look up the variables from vendor_message_text to get a friendly explanation of the type of variable

- File location: lookups/cisco_ios_variable_representations.csv
- Lookup fields: vendor_variable_field, vendor_variable_type_of_information
- Lookup contents: See the file contents

### Configure Cisco Networks

Details of any configurations a user must make in order to get the app running.

### Troubleshoot Cisco Networks

***No data seen in the app***

***Cause***

* Cicso devices not configured or incorrectly configured for logging
* Cisco Networks Add-on not installed

***Resolution***
* Check the device configuration
* Install the Cisco Networks Add-on

***Not seeing any inventory information?***

The app needs a feature called Cisco Smart Call Home (SCH) to be enabled on the devices.

***Cause***
* Smart Call Home Input not enabled
* Devices not configured to send Smart Call Home events at specific intervals
* ip http client source-interface SOURCE_INTERFACE not set on your device

***Resolution***
* Enable a TCP input for Smart Call Home using the instructions in the app's Help page
* Enable Smart Call Home logging on your devices using the instructions in the app's Help page.
* Set the correct source interface on your devices.

### Upgrade Cisco Networks
1. In your Splunk Enterprise web interface, click on App(s) -> Manage Apps
1. Click on Install app from file
1. Select the file you downloaded, Click Upload, selecting Upgrade app. Restart Splunk if required

### Example Use Case ###
* Find flapping ports
* View configuration changes
* View access list logs
* View events by Cisco access point MAC address
* View top events by device model, software and hostname
* Identify rare and common log messages by facility, mnemonic and device type
