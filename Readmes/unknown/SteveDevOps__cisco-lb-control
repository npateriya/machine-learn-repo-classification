# cisco-lb-control
Control context written in Bash -  used for manipulating a Cisco ACE 4710 load balancer. One-off script and menu system created for pulling, activating or getting state of nodes.

<b>This project makes the following assumptions:</b>
<ol>
<li>you have cli access to your Cisco device
<li>you have access/sudo privs to a linux system with expect installed, and this linux system has route/access (firewall acl) to your target device
<li>***you have a copy of the core expect script provided by Cisco: http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/Remote_VTY_Command_Script     <br>After you clone this repo, place/create vty_runcmd.exp in (~/cisco/targetserver and ~/cisco/env)
<li>you have knowledge of cisco lb interaction - cli or gui and understand lb concepts
</ol>

This project is broken up into two sets of directories containining scripts:
<ol>
<li>targetserver - used for one-off rserver/farm manipulation: drop/bleed, cmd files written on the fly
<li>env - framework for menu system used to drive farm manipulation: bleed only, cmd files hardcoded
</ol>

..more to come..
