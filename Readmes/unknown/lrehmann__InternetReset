InternetReset
=============
This code is intended to reset Motorola Modems, Linksys Routers, and OBI devices with little modification by the user (usernames, passwords, and IP address only)
For future commits, I hope this code can be devloped into something that can effortlessly solve internet connectivity users. 
I suggest setting this python code to run as a cron job on the desired device. "python /path/to/code/checkconn.py"
Cheers!
