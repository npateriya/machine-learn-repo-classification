# SecureCRT-Cisco-Script
Python script created to login to Cisco switches using SecureCRT and read information from them, it then writes some configuration back. Before it does any changes, it saves the running config to a TFTP server I assigned, in case of any issues during update. This was tested in a local environment before being used in Production switches.
