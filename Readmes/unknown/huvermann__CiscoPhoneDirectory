# CiscoPhoneDirectory

Python based software to provide the fritzbox phone book on the Cisco IP Phone.

## Enironment
This software uses Python >= 3.5<br>
Python dependencies: Flask 0.12.2, fritzconnection (0.6.3)
Phone: Cisco IP Phone 7941G<br>
Fritzbox: Fritz!Box 7490<br>
IDE: Visual Studio 2015<br>
The software should work with other Cisco 79xx devices and other fritzbox versions, but this has not been tested. 




## Installation

Get the source code:
```bash
git https://github.com/huvermann/CiscoPhoneDirectory.git
```
Change into the directory
cd CiscoPhoneDirectory

Install the python dependencies and make the python script executable:
```bash
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
sudo chmod +x runserver.py
```

## Configuration

Sorry! The description of the configuration file is obsolete. It will be updated in the next days.
<br>
Edit the coinfig.json file to configure your local settings.
```bash
nano config.json
```
Content of the config.json:
```json
{
  
  "serveraddress": "192.168.178.198", <- hostname where this script is running.
  "serverport": 5556, <- Port where this script is running
  "fritzbox": {
    "enabled": 1,
    "menuname": "Fritz!BoxContacts",
    "address": "192.168.178.1", <- IP-address of your fritzbox.
    "password": "fritzboxpassword" <- Password of your fritzbox.
  },
  "googlecsv": {
    "enabled": 1,  <- To disable this feature, set this to 0.
    "filename": "google.csv", <- path to your google csv export file.
    "menuname" :  "Google!Contacts"
  }
}
```
In this case, this application is running on ip-address 192.168.178.198. The Cisco Ip Phone has to be configured to fetch the phone directory from this address. (See Configure and update the Cisco Ip Phone)

## Usage

Start the server:
```bash
python3 runserver.py
```
## Test if it's running

After you have started the script, you can open a web browser with the following url:
http://192.168.178.198/directory.xml
<br>
Replace the ip with the ip of the host where you installed the script.
You should get the following output:
```xml
<CiscoIPPhoneMenu>
<MenuItem>
<URL>http://192.168.178.198:5556/fritzfonebook.xml</URL>
<Name>Fritz!BoxContacts</Name>
</MenuItem>
<MenuItem>
<URL>http://192.168.178.198:5556/googlecsv.xml</URL>
<Name>Google!Contacts</Name>
</MenuItem>
<Prompt>Select a directory!</Prompt>
</CiscoIPPhoneMenu>
```
This is what the Cisco Phone needs to get new directory entries. If the user of the phone selects the entry "Fritz!BoxContacts" the phone requests a telephone directory from "http://192.168.178.198:5556/fritzfonebook.xml"
.<br> You can test this url with your webbrowser. You should get the phone numbers of your fritzbox phone book.<br/>


## Configure and update the Cisco IP Phone 7941G


To get the CiscoIpPhone running with FritzBox, the phone needs the SIP IP Firmware installed. Normally the phone comes with the SCCP firmware. 
Download the latest firmware for your phone from here:<br>
https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html?mdfid=269065653&i=rm
<br>
Cisco support page:<br>
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/collaboration-endpoints/unified-ip-phone-7941g/model.html
<br>
To configure your Cisco IP Phone, a TFTP-Server is required! You will need a "IPDefault.cnf" or a "SEP(MAC_Address).cnf.xml" in your TFTP root folder.

In the "IPDefault.cnf" find a line like

directory_url: "http://192.168.178.198:5006/directory.xml"

Or in the file ""SEP(MAC_Address).cnf.xml"" configure the ip address where you installed this service:
```xml
<directoryURL>http://192.168.178.198:5556/directory.xml</directoryURL>
```
Modifiy the .cnf files before you start the firmware update process!<br>

After the Cisco IP Phone has been updated it should be able to request the phone directory from the FritzBox.
The new items are shown in the display after pressing the directory key.
