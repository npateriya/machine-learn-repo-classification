# UCSDScripts
A number of examples of how you can interact with UCSD, these examples will grow over time

### Dashing
This is an example of using the USCD API with a pretty web based dashboard.

### ucsd-task
This uses the API to provide a new UI to order catalog items

### ucsdServiceRequest.py
This is a python script that uses the UCSD API to pull back a list of the service requests and formats in a nice way.

###  ucsdServiceRequestExtra.py
This is a python script that pretty much does the same as ucsdServiceRequest.py. It exists as originally when I started to use the main API the status returned wasnâ€™t as informative as it is now so I needed to make use of an additional API to achieve the same result.
