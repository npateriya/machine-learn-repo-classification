A very trivial example showing how to use a Node Step plugin
to execute IOS commands to a Cisco device via SSH.

This is a script-based plugin that demonstrates a few features:

* Using a script to execute an action to a network device.
* CODE display block to execute a batch of IOS commands
* Reading SSH key data from keystore to authenticate to the device
* Grouping plugin config properties
