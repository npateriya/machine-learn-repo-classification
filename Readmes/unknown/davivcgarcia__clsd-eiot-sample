Hackathon@CLSD - Sample App for EIoT
=================================================

This repository aims to show an example of Python application that uses the Enterprise IoT platform (Talem) to connected sensors and electronic components into the Cisco network infrastructure.

For this example, I'll be using:

 * Python 2
 * Python's Virtual Environment
 * Cisco's version of PyUSB
 * Flask
 * Docker
