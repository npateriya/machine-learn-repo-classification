# mac-vendor-finder
Takes input from Cisco device (or just a list of MAC addresses) and gives a sortable table of MAC address-to-vendor mappings.

It is a very simple PHP script that reads the locally-stored oui.txt vendor list and maps vendors to MAC addresses.
The newest list can always be found at [standards-oui.ieee.org/oui.txt](http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui.txt).

## Samples
There is a sample mac.css file included as well.

## Required files
oui.txt must be in the same folder as mac.php

## External calls
The script calls to cdnjs.cloudflare.com for jQuery and jQuery Tablesorter
