# DEVNET-2073

This repository will be used for the Cisco Live US DEVNET-2073 session

Software included:
 - Spark_APIs_2073.py
 - CMX_APIs_2073.py
 - APIC-EM_APIs_2073.py
 - SparkConnect.py full lab code.

During this lab we will use Cisco Spark and two DevNet Sandboxes for APIC-EM and CMX


A small number of APIs requests will create a new application to enable on-demand Wi-Fi guest networks.

We will interact with Spark’s easy to use APIs to read room messages, and with CMX to locate users of our
Application in the Enterprise network.
APIC-EM device inventory accessed through APIs will identify the Wireless LAN Controllers.

The Prime Infrastructure WLAN configuration APIs will ensure configuration will only be deployed
to the user’s physical location, for the duration asked by the user.
The entire configuration will be removed at the end of the time allowed for the Hotspot to be enabled.

Small Application code changes could create Hotspot networks based on schedule, incident response or social events.
