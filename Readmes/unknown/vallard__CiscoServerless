Exploring Serverless APIs

## Parse example

```
cd
parse-server-example
npm start
```

Now launch the dashboard: 
```
parse-dashboard --appId myAppId --masterKey Master --serverURL "http://localhost:1337/parse"
```


## MASHAPE example

This example uses an API found on Mashape that contains photos of 
ski resorts in Italy.  To use this you must first set the 
environment variable ```MASHAPE_KEY``` for it to connect. 

Then ```cd``` to the mashape1 directory and run:

```
lein figwheel
```
This will bring the server up on port 3449.
