# The Idea
 As of 2010, there was an estimated 450,000 preventable medication-related adverse events that occur in the U.S. every year. With this Cisco Spark Bot, you can tell it what pills you are taking and it will consult the US National Library of Medicine APIs to determine exactly what it is you are taking based on the description or RXCUI (RxNorm Concept Unique Identifier) that uniquely identifies what you are taking. Once it knows everything you are taking, it can then consult another NLM API to determine potentially deadly mixes of prescription drugs. We know there is a need for something like this because of the amount of deaths that are preventable (450K as of 2010). The internet can be confusing, make it easier to confirm your safety with this Cisco Spark Bot!
 # Explaining
 This was my first integration with Cisco Spark. I utilized a CiscoSpark repository to learn about webhooks and how to host them on my own devices. As such, I failed to see the ability to integrate with, say, Amazon AWS Services. By the time I figured this out, I had already developed 80% of the system that I created here. 
 ## What are all the hidden files for?
 All of the hidden files represent storing information that I pulled from various APIs or flags. I need flags to help the system know where in the process of the conversation it is at. The flags are used to create context with the user, and allow the bot to respond to the user with only the most relevant information, rather than being out of the loop, so to say. `flags_explained.txt` contains explanations on the purpose of all of the hidden files
