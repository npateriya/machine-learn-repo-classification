## Cisco WLC Content Pack

This content pack will spawn an input on UDP port 10514 and will successfully parse Cisco WLC syslog messages. There is a limitation in setting syslog to any other port than 514 with Cisco WLC's so this input assumes you have a load balancer in front handling the input on port 514 and forwarding to a non-standard port in the backend.
