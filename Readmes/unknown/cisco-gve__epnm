## ASE AMERICAS Team 1 - Software Project Q3FY17
This repository contains code for the software project of ASE AMERICAS Team 1.

The project is organized in a 3 step process, notably:
* **Step 1** - Collect/streamline/write basic scripts for common tasks/operations of the main Cisco APIs
* **Step 2** - Build a 'Wrapper' API for the basic scripts in step 1
* **Step 3** - Write a simple use case that leverage the 'Wrapper' API. The use case may also leverage APIs outside the core ones

You will find the corresponding folders for each step.

### Sample Application - CE MPLS Turn-Up Process
This project will develop a set of tools to turn-up a new MPLS network consisting of NCS 4200s and ASR 9k devices in support of Circuit Emulation circuits running over that MPLS network. The tools will utilize EPN-Ms REST APIs to configure the device by device parameters to allow a network administrator to configure the full network in one shot based on a small set of initial parameters.
