# CiscoRouter
This system is my FYP project that entitled PHP Telnet To Cisco Router: Cisco Router Admin. This system is developed to identify an alternative way to configure the cisco router without using command-line, to develop a user-friendly interface using web-based application and to test the system using web-based application.

# Hardware and Software Requirement
Hardware requirement that I used are my laptop, Cisco Router, console cable, 3com cable, and LAN cable while the software requirement that I used are Appserv because it is easy to install Apache, PHP, MySQL for programming purpose. Next, I used Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 to design and implement the code.
