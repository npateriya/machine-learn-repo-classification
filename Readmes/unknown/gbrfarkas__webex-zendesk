# webex-zendesk

A small tool to quickly create Cisco WebEx meetings from the Zendesk tickets screen.

The app automatically generates a meeting topic based on the ticket number and the subject, and invites the requestor and the assignee (if any). It also checks whether the planned meeting overlaps with any other meetings on the same WebEx account.

Please note that this was quickly written for one specific scenario and not guaranteed to work with different WebEx account setups.
