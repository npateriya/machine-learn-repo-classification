# python for cisco
A python libary network automation

so far the documentation is in the code but it should be pretty easy to use

The idea about this is to make network automation simple by having the ability to have a host file with difrent host groups and just pushing commands out to a group or a single device at a time.
in the future a goal is to intigrate SNMP support, topology maps, and host auto discovery but sugestions are welcome
