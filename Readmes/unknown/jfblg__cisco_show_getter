# CISCO SHOW GETTER
The script may be useful for network admins who need to automate getting of the same command from multiple cisco devices.

### HOW TO
1. make sure you have installed all dependencies listed in the requirements.txt

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Adjust the config.yml file
 - specify your username
 - specify your password
 - specify the command you would like to execute
 - specify the cisco device hostnames from which you would like to obtain the output
The script will resolve the hostnames to the IP addresses using the network setting on your computer system.

3. run the script

    ```
    python3 cisco_show_getter
    ```

4. If successfully executed, in the same folder will appear new files. For each devices, separated file, each with the output from the executed command.

Enjoy!

Note: This script is more or less a python programming learning project for me. I'm focusing on the following:
- correct descriptions of the each function
- using of the context managers
- using of the named tuples
- PEP8 compliance
- informative README.md file
- the LICENSE file included

### TODO
- try to use sets somewhere

### CHANGELOG
- 20.10.2016 - Formatting of the code according to PEP8
