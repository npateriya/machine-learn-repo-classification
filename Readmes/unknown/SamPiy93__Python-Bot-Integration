# Python-Bot-Integration
Simple Bot integration with cisco spark messaging API.

Aim of this implementation is to build a common platform where any vendor can integrate their bots to a common platform by providing a bot account and access tokens. 
As the first step i would like to provide the bot implementation and the cisco spark integration details for one on one chat.
