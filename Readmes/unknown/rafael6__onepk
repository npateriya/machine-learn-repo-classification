# onepk
Cisco OnePK stuff.
w6e1:
Using the onepk_helper library establish a onePK connection to one of the two lab routers.  
From this lab router obtain the product_id and SerialNo.

w6e2:
Print out the interface statistics for FastEthernet4 on the two lab routers 
(rtr1 = port 12345, rtr2 = port 6789).

w6e3:
Using onePK and the VTY Service obtain the output from the 'show version' command.  Use 'terminal length 0' to disable output paging (i.e. disable '--More--' prompting).
