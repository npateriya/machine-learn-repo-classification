# Background

Started in 1984, Cisco went public in Feb 1990 and by 1992, the company was featured in Fortune as second fastest growing company in US. In 1993, Cisco acquisition spree begin with the acquisition of Crescendo Communications and after that many more and Cisco extended its product portfolio to different areas.

In, 1995 it introduced applications for selling products or services on its website the same year John Chambers was named the CEO of Cisco. By 1998, Cisco’s market capitalization was at over US$ 100 B. It had a state of the art supply chain and operated without any inventory. In early 2000, Cisco was one of the most valuable companies in the world flushed with funds. So, Cisco decided to invest more in acquisitions and acquired another 25 companies. 

But in early 2000, it was unable to meet the demands for its products and customers had to wait long and customers began opting for competitors products. And Cisco pushed contract manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture and hold inventory, committing itself to buying large quantities from them.

The year 2001, was hard for Cisco as it had to face a recession, its supply chain choked, it had a stocked up inventory, within few months company’s growth rate dropped significantly.

By late 2008, its stocks took a beating along with stocks of other companies but, its business continued to be strong with US$ 26 B in cash. Cisco was one of the few companies to withstand the global economic downturn in the fiscal year 2008-09. 

# Cisco in Recessionary Times

In late October 2008, Cisco faced a reduced demand for its products in US and the company forecasted that it may face the same challenges in other markets. And the company took steps like cutting down capital expenditure, freezing recruitment, reducing travel cost by teleconferencing where possible, Chambers himself had 200 virtual meetings out of his 260 meetings.

Despite downturn Cisco, showed aggressive strategy in recessionary times and saw it as an opportunity to invest in new emerging technologies and acquiring companies and gaining more market share and adding more to its product portfolio.
