# VPN tunnel configuration using Packet Tracer

This project is about configuring and establishing VPN tunnel between two networks. 
Cisco packet tracer is used to simulate routers, switches.
There are 3 networks designed in the project, and VPN tunnel created between two of them.
The project steps are as follows;
1. Configure routers.
2. Configure hosts for static address.
3. Configure static routes between routers. (Dynamic routing can also be done by configuring any of the routing protocols).
4. Configure extended ACL (access control list) explicitly permitting traffic between the two routers.
5. Configure IPsec phase 1 and phase 2 between routers of Site A and Site B.
6. Configure VPN tunnel between the said two routers.

**NOTE: For simulation purpose, any router which has cryptographic properties (2911 in this case). 
Security Technology Package license must be activated in order to complete the project.
In order to activate the package, following commands must be run in a router in privileged mode:
R1(config)# license boot module c2900 technology-package securityk9
R1(config)# end
R1# copy running-config startup-config
R1# reload
