ios-wildcard_to_netmask.py is a script that will search through a file, locating Cisco IOS wildcard masks, then invert them into normal network masks.

This script is written for ease of use in macOS and Linux, however, it can be modified to use a Desktop path in Windows.  I have not implemented that capability.

In order to use this script, follow these steps:

1) Place the file that you wish to change the Cisco IOS wildcard network masks to regular network masks on your macOS or Linux desktop directory (~/Desktop) and ensure that the file name is InvertMe.txt (case sensitive).

2) Run the following command in your Terminal/local shell:

python ios-wildcard_to_netmask.py

3) The script will parse through the file, change the network masks and save the changes to a new file on your macOS or Linux desktop directory (~/Desktop) named Inverted.txt (case sensitive).  This way, the script doesn't modify the contents of the original file.
