# Airport-Network-Security
To design a network for an Airport department to provide security using Firewall.The network design was implememented based on VLAN with Cisco routers,server and switches. The network has three departments,check-in,waiting,security and a high speed internet connection.In the waiting zone user has access to free wi-fi and services like email,http and ftp.In the check-in area,the user can either self check-in or desk self-in.All the departments donot not have access to video-conferencing, but all other communication should be allowed on the internet. The users in all the departments should have inter access communication with each other. All the departments should be on different IP networks.
