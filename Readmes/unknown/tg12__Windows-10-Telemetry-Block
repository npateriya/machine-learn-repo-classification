# Windows-10-Telemetry-Block
Block Windows "Telemetry" with Cisco ACL's

Following on from the in-depth post here... https://voat.co/v/technology/comments/835741

I have created a Cisco ACL that blocks all traffic to the IP's listed. 

Simply copy and paste this and apply this to your Interfaces on a Cisco Device.
