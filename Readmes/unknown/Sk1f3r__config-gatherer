**Config gatherer**
The simpliest script to send commands to Cisco devices and save output to separate files.
Based on authentication data located in Excel file.

Script is useful as a fast method to send commands and gather outputs to a bunch of devices with different sets of authentication parameters.

**Basic collection contains two files**:
- python script;
- excel workbook with targets and authentication data.

**Excel file contains following columns**:
- hostname (informational only);
- IP address;
- username (with priviledge level 15);
- password;
- type of connection (telnet or ssh).

**Usage**:

`[Linux]`
- git clone https://github.com/Sk1f3r/config-gatherer.git
- sudo python setup.py install

`[Windows]`
- download the script and the workbook as is

`[Shared steps]`
- ensure that the script and the workbook are in a same directory;
- update the workbook to a correct state;
- update section VAR in the python script;
- change excel filename as needed: variable 'data_source' (default 'auth.xls');
- change a list of commands as needed: variable 'commands' (default 'show cdp neighbors' and 'show ip interface brief');
- excute the script (-v key is available for debugging)

**List of required non-builtin modules**:
- xlrd
- netmiko

**TODO**:
- PEP8 style correction;
- test with Juniper devices;
- decide if "enable secret" option is worth to be added.
