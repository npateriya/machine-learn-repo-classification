I have a lot of cisco switch, and sometimes i need to access all the switch to get some data or information from the switch. I found some script online, then i modified the script to match with my enviroment.</br>
This script try to get the serial number from the cisco switch. </br>
Save the cisco_inven.sh, then create "log" folder.</br>
chmod +x cisco_inven.sh.</br>
After the script is running, you will get the log file</br></br></br>
