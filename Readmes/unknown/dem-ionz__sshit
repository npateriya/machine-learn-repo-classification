# sshit SSH Scanner - if you can't pwn at least one ssh you get your money back... wait... :\




 Hey hosting my servers ain't free. ;)

the simplest little ssh scanner bruteforce tool - 
finds cisco ios boxes, busybox, WAP routers, Sonic wall firewalls, and more. ;)
for now only uses the username root, and the password admin (hey they're default a lot of places) 

1) git clone this shit or copy it
2) chmod +x it
3) pick a range, like 125.12 

$./sshit.py 125 12 (don't include the dot, it will error out, another fix for later.)
Hit enter when it tells you.

4) ???? wait

5 ) wait for scan to finish to 255.255 

6) kill the python script in another terminal

7) $cat rooted.txt - check for loot

8) give me some crypto for my time (optional)
