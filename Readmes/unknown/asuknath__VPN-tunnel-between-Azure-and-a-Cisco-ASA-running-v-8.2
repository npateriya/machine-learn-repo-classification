# VPN tunnel between Azure and a Cisco ASA running v8.2

Currently the minimum OS Version Supported for a Cisco ASA device is 8.3. However you might be able to use a device with 8.2 as well.

If you are running Cisco ASA OS version 8.3 and higher you will be able to use following link gives a Sample Configuration to setup a Static Routing Gateway between your VPN Device and Azure:

New configuration template looks the same except for the NAT.  The equivalent command would be NAT 0 in 8.2.

I followed Microsoft Sample configuration and adjusted configure for Cisco ASA v8.2.
