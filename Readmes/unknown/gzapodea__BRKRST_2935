# BRKRST-2935
Repo for Cisco Live US Presentation BRKRST-2935 session.

Software included:

- BRKRST_2935_ERNA_CL.py - full lab/POC Python code.
- ERNA_init.py - init file for variables


Network Programmability and Software Defined Networking (SDN) have changed the way network engineers look at
infrastructure and operations. Conversations about configuring networks are increasingly focused on the new
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and less around the familiar Command Line Interface (CLI).

Many engineers have questions about how this can be applied to existing environments.

This session will showcase the use of the open REST API's available in

  -  APIC-EM
  -  ASAv
  -  Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI)
  -  Cisco UCS Director
  -  Spark
  -  Tropo

to dynamically provision secured remote access to Enterprise resources for a third party entity. The code will configure firewalls, routers, switches, and Data Center compute resources.

CLI Templates to be deployed to the DC and Remote L3 switch are included:

 - GRE_DC_Config - configuration file for the DC CSR1000v
 - GRE_DC_Delete - configuration file to restore the initial configuration for the DC CSR1000v
 - GRE_Remote_Config - configuration file for the remote Layer 3 Access Switch
 - GRE_Remote_Delete - configuration file to restore the initial configuration for the remote Layer 3 Access Switch

This code is shared as a demo, only.
