Cisco
=====
This is a client project for Cisco which was used to demonstrate deep integration with massive train systems, switching, security, and failsafe.  An interesting feature of this project is that it is Angular, but can be run without a Node server.  Opening the file html/index.html will open an index from which the three separate components can be launched.

The UI is not easily discoverable, but I can demonstrate when we meet over chat.
