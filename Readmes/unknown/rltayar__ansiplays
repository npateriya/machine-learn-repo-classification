Repo for my home lab and learning

'site.yml' playbook:
- Playbook example for updating servers with yum or apt update and upgrade by operating system
- Includes adding packages via apt using a standard loop to save on size of playbook
- Example of incoming webhook for slack to post timestamp and completion of the playbook
- Using ansible vault to protect ansible token (in group_vars "pass.yml")
- Using cron to run playbook every day at 8am

I will be adding more over the next few months as I continue to learn
