to run all programs type
	$ sh run.sh
This will compile all the files and run them.
Examples of the Graphs used in test.java are below

Note: I implemented this assuming that all childern are all edges connected to a
node. This means that if you wanted to call walk on a node it would need to be 
in the syntax MyNode.walkGraph(MyNode).

For reading from a file and counting the words: I assumed I would not have to 
worry about efficency since you asked for a "dirty" program. It could honstely 
run in a much better Big-O since I did no sorting and did a linear search. 
This Reads in from the file input.txt.
