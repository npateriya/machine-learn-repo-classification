# Gemma, the MBA Chatbot

Gemma is a Chatbot that lets you query information about an MBA course. 
The chatbot provides answers for questions that have already been installed on it. 
In case the chatbot does not satisfy a student's query or the lecturers want to give their own input, our platform allows the lecturers to interact directly with the students.

The Rocketbots.io platform consists of:
* A Dashboard that provides statistical data about the classroom's interactions with the chatbot. This includes:
Users Subscribed, Messages Received, Gender Distribution, Tags Assigned.

* A Contacts tab which is used to keep track of tags and bot status for students.
* A Message tab which allows lecturers to directly message the students.
* A Broadcast tab that allows lecturers to message anyone with corresponding tags.

The Rocketbots.io platform is an intellectual property of Rocketbots and therefore the source code cannot be shared.
