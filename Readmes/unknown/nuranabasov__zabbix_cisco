# zabbix_cisco
Template for Cisco Network devices.
Just import this template and create host with this template. Template created with LLD which can find all interfaces with description and aliases.

PS: After adding template to the host don't forget write on macros 
{$SNMP_COMMUNITY} = Your SNMP Community.
