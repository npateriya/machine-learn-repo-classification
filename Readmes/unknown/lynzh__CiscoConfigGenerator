# Config generator for Cisco

This config generator was made in 2014, reverse engineered from a perl script,
forged in the depths of a shadowy terminal, beware ye who enter, for it is
ugly as shit.

# But
it works!

# Depencies

make sure you are running linux or windows with a cygwin shell

# How does it work?

run ./generator fresh

the output ends up in /tmp/configs
if you edit the generator and re-run the command,
it will delete /tmp/configs and output it again.

# TODO

Clean it up
allow arguments to be passed
fix/rewrite dhcpd6.conf generator part
