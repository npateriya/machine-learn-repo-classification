# python-scripts
My own collection of Python scripts I've written for Cisco administration

The parent scripts can be in any folder, however it requires 4 subfolders to work properly (not all are used in each script):

Folders:
1. configBackups - Used with the "backup-running-configs.py" script to store all config backups
2. lib - Stores all of my custom libraries I've written for my scripts
3. logs - If any logs or output are saved to a file, it will go here
4. textfiles - Any files to be used for input should go here, usually as a .txt file unless otherwise specified

You can find my blog at https://iwroteascript.com for more info on everything listed.
