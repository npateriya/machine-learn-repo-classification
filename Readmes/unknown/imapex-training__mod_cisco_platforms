# Module: Developing with Cisco Platforms

[item]: # (/slide)

## Abstract

Cisco products have long been seen in a "what you see is what you get" light, but that is no longer the case.  All new products have been designed with programmability and APIs from day 0.  Some examples of this category include Cisco Spark, Application Centric Infrastructure, Cisco Unified Computing System, and IOx.  Adding programmatic capabilities to older product lines began many years ago, and has accelerated recently.  Cisco IOS, NX-OS, and ASA all had APIs and data models added or are in progress.  Lastly, every newly aquired technology, such as Tropo, Jasper, and CloudLock, have robust programmatic interfaces, with many of them having been "born in the cloud".  Investigating every platform from Cisco that could be considered "programmable" would be impossible, but in this module we'll look at many of them.  We will include some of the most popular platforms, as well as some that maybe less well known, but have excellent potential in development projects.
