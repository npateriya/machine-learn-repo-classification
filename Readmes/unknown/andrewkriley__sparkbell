# sparkbell
A very basic door bell project using a Raspberry Pi and Cisco Spark

1) Edit the config.py file and enter in your Cisco Spark "roomId" and your Bearer "token" to properly authenticate
2) Find a suitable WAV file to play and call it doorbell.wav
    NB - the Raspberry Pi only has line out audio which won't have enough power to drive a speaker to a decent level as a real doorbell.
3) Use PIN 23 on the rPI to connect a doorbell button. https://pinout.xyz/ if you don't remember the pins

Have fun!
