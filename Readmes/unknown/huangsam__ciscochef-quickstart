This is a [web application](http://ciscochef-samhua.rhcloud.com/) that
shows a dynamically created map of places that my Cisco coworkers
and I have deemed worthy of eating at around the San Jose campus.
It's responsive, meaning that it will look great on computers,
smartphones and tablets. This map will benefit not only employees
at Cisco, but also people around the Bay Area.
