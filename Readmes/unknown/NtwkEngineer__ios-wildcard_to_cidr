ios-wildcard_to_cidr.py is a script that will search through a file, locating Cisco IOS wildcard masks, then invert them into CIDR.

This script is written for ease of use in macOS and Linux, however, it can be modified to use a Desktop path in Windows. I have not implemented that capability.

In order to use this script, follow these steps:

1) Place the file that you wish to change the IOS wildcard network masks into CIDR on your macOS or Linux desktop directory (~/Desktop) and ensure that the file name is InvertMe.txt (case sensitive).

2) Run the following command in your Terminal/local shell:

python ios-wildcard_to_cidr.py

3) The script will parse through the file, change the network masks and save the changes to a new file on your macOS or Linux desktop directory (~/Desktop) named Converted.txt (case sensitive). This way, the script doesn't modify the contents of the original file.
