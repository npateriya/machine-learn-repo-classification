# setup-l2tp-vpn-server-amz

Scripts to build your own IPsec VPN server, with IPsec/L2TP and Cisco IPsec on EC2 with Amazon Linux AMI


## Notes

This script is based on work of Lin Song:

The latest original version of Lin Song script is available at:

  https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn

I just modify the original script, it can work with Amazon Linux AMI.
