## Ebin
Creating a sophisticated network of ebins for a better waste management. We are developing a dustbin which notifies the muncipality manager and the User(Citizens) about the varying waste level of public wastebins in realtime. It also notifies the muncipality if more dustbins are required in a given area.

### NodeMCU_final

It is to be updated to the NodeMCU using the Arduino IDE and using the respective NodeMCU wrapper for it.
The NodeMCU sends the depth of dustbin over wifi and is recieved by the server

### Server

Both are made to run on the raspberry pi (Cloud) they can be accessed from there by any other person
The port 8000 is to be accessed from the external ip address of the RPi which shows the Google Maps with the Empty dustbin coloured in grreen and the Filled dustbin coloured in red.

### Muncipal

Made to run on Raspberry Pi.
Same as server but has thr extra feature of notifying the muncipality of filled dustbins
