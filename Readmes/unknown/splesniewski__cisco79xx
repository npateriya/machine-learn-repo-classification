Every few years I have a itch to play with these phones.  During the
latest stint I put a bit of polish on the on the commands I always need.

The GNUmakefile is self contained and will produce images and audio
files ready for the phone.  It's not what I would acctually use on the
phone but it's good reference for working output.
