Spark App for The ACI App Center

*** Update 3/3 ***
When running:
	Note: The subscription listener runs as a separate thread so wait for the event to be recongized before querying new information to avoid confusion as to what response maps to what.

	
	Use menu option 1 to retrieve health scores and subscribe to the tenant faults
	Use menu option 0 to trigger sabatoge(), this will toggle the EPG fault and generate an event each time. This will test our subscription and how we handle the event
	-- next step is to handle this data and push to spark

Work in progress

This application will facilitate communication between Cisco's APIC[s] and administrators through the use of a Spark Bot.
The application will assign the Bot to a room designated by the administrator and will provide unsolicited updates to the room based on predetermined severity thresholds. The admin will also be able to push policy and configurations to the controller[s] through the spark room.
