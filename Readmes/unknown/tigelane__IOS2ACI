# IOS2ACI
Conversion tool from a Cisco IOS based configuration to an ACI Tenant, BridgeDomain, and EPG

Utilizes Cisco ACIToolkit: https://github.com/datacenter/acitoolkit

Simple script with very little error checking to take all of the SVIs from a IOS
configuration and turn them into EPGs under a single Tenant and single Applicaiton Profile.
By default this script sets all of the subnets to advertise.
