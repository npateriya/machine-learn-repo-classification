# jabber-archive-viewer
Tool that enables viewing of Cisco Jabber message archive.

As Cisco Jabber is storing the message archive in an obscure location in a sqlite database I've created a simple tool that retrieves the archive and displays it as an HTML document.

viewer_tkhtml.py - displays it in Tkinter window using tkinterhtml module (created as a proof of concept, not working on it anymore)

viewer_webbrowser.py - displays it in a new tab in your browser
archive_recorder.py - as Jabber has a limit of messages per contect this tool is creating new database with message history and adds new records from the original archive so nothings get deleted. Can be viewed with viewer_webbrowser.py

In /dist/ you'll find exe versions of both tools created using pyinstaller.

Created using Python 3.5.2
