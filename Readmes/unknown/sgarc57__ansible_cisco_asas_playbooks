# Ansible Example PLaybooks for Cisco ASA and Nexus NXOS

# Author: Steven Garcia

The environment used to develop these playbooks is redhat 7.2, while making use of some of the epel repository, so long as
python and pip are installed, along with the requirements provided, this should work.

execute the requirements.sh script to get all requirements on a redhat 7.2 system.

I have recently added the example playbooks listed above check the .output files to see the output for the above commands

I did have to force the local user account to be present when running  the above playbooks

 An example command would be like this:
# sudo su  admin -c "ansible-playbook  -vvv asa-command-test.yml"

This worked successfully, without issue for cisco ASA
Contact if any questions.
