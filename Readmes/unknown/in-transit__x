Works with OSSEC syslog server to determine and mitigate threats using Cisco ASA Firewalls. 

This was inspired by the older Capcom character MegaMan (Rockman) X.  The thought is to have a service that will protect your monitored hosts from consistant attack attempts by stopping all future attempts in the firewall.  This is assuming you have a well-tuned OSSEC instance.
