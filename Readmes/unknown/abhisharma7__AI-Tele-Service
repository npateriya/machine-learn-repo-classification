# AI Tele Service

# Inspiration:
Our initial inspiration was came from facebook recent AI feature which describe the posted images to blind people. That was our motivation and inspiration to develop something similar to that and not limiting that feature just to facebook. We have developed an andriod application which anyone can download and use.

# What it does:
Its an andriod application which needs access to the Internet and camera API. User can click a picture and he will receive a automated phone call which gives the user a comprehensive description of the content of image.

# How we built it:
It was build on Andriod which uses amazon aws service and microsoft computer vision and emotion api (AI). Another integral part of this application is the use of tropo automated voice calls.

# Challenges we ran into:
Challenges which we have face are connecting the andriod application with rest api then microsoft azure AI doesn't give comprehensive description for some images which were click from our camera.

# Technology used:
* Amazon AWS Compute and RDS
* Microsoft Azure Computer Vision API
* Cisco Tropo
* Python Socket Programming
* Jave
* Android

# Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We worked on a lot of technologies, multi platform integration, AI api which were not sure of and biggest achievement is we were able to successfully completed them in the 24 hours time.
