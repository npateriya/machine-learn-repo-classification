# switch_config_generator_0.1
Generates Cisco 3850 config based on backend database entries 

The prupose of this program is to allow users to easily configure 1000s of Cisco 3850 switches based on the company standard config. 

There are a few steps involved:
1.) The import.py file imports a CSV file (edited by the user) into SQLite database
2.) The querySQL.py file allows the user to enter a hostname to generate a config based on existing data entry. It will do a lookup using hostname as the primary key - and look for all related data. For example, device ip address, number of switches in the stack, etc. 
3.) querySQL.py copies the baseconfig.txt (which also contains the variables) and places them into a new folder containing the district in which the switch is to be shipped. 
4.) querySQL.py grabs the data in the SQL database, reads the newly created configuration file, and replaces all variables based on data entered into SQL. 


Looking for some pointers or anything I can do better. Also looking for a way for the program to generate all switches at once, instead of the user typing in the switch hostname for it to work.
