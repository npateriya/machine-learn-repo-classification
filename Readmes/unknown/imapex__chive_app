When adding additional code or making changes to the project, please ensure that unit tests are added to cover the
new functionality and that the entire test suite is run against the project before submitting the code.
Minimal code coverage can be verified using tools such as coverage.py.

For instance, after installing coverage.py, the toolkit can be run with the command::

    coverage run tests.py

and an HTML report of the code coverage can be generated with the command::

    coverage html
