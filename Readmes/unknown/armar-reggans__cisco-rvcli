Cisco RV0XX Command Line Interface
===========

Command Line Interface to the Cisco RV042 (RV0XX) V3 VPN Routers. 

Note: This script is only for the V3 hardware.

The Cisco RV series routers are a great SMB option [low cost] for remote connectivity. However, from the factory, you can only manage these devices through a web interface. So managing a multi-location setup programatically can be problematic once you have more than two of these deployed. I leveraged the work Etre_Libre has done (http://www.treshaut.net/viewtopic.php?t=37&p=138) to enable ssh access to these device so they can be easily configured via a cli. 

Etre_Libre has modified the firmware to enable telnet, ssh, WoL and a root password that is known (which can be easily changed). I basically picked up where he left off. I create a shell to behave like a typical router with a cli. You use get and set command to set configuration parameters. I will update this file with additional details as time permits. I at least wanted to provide the script for anyone to use/contribute.

Just place the script in /etc/flash/persos and run the routercli.sh script. You should get a prompt that will now accept commands. If you need help, email me at armar@reggans.com

I provided the firmware as well, although you can build it yourself if you want to.

Note: The root password is set to : cisco2014*
