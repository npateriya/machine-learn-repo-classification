# ip_phone_search

## Synopsis
Search for specific Cisco IP phone models within an IP range. Gathers data about the affected phones. (Model number, mac address, serial number, host name,  etc.)
It saves that data to a csv and texts me when the scan completes.

## Motivation
Certain models of Cisco IP phones were manufactured with faulty memory components as documented below.
We wanted to work with Cisco to replace them and they needed detailed info about the phones.
