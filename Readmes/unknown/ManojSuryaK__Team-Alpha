# Team-Alpha
github repository for rvce cisco hackathon, team alpha!!!!!
To provide a technical solution to the food crisis by applying DeepLearning,IOT and cloud technologies to optimise yield in agricultural farms and an approach to bring the idea of a smart urban farm into reality.
Codes and their functionalities :
*raspberrypi_farm.py is the main automation script(MCU)main control unit
*vr-trial.py is the bridge between the ibm watson's bluemix visual recognition API and all the hardware on the farm(MCU)
*arduino_farm.ino code does the controlling part and sensing part(SCU) supporting control unit
*farm_arduino.ino code moniters the farm (drip irrigation) and sending emails to the owner in certain situations from distant location 
(RCU) remote control unit.
*upload.py is the script utilised to upload the images and train the COGNITIVE service provide by ibm bluemix(visual recognition api) for pest detection.Trained around 200 captured images.
