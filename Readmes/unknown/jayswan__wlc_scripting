This script does the following:

1. Reads 802.11ac radio metrics from Cisco WLC using netmiko.
2. Parse the output into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Pickles the output in the local directory as "test.pkl".

This allows you to use IPython, load the pickle, and play around with the data interactively.

###Known Issues###
1. Frequently, netmiko throws a socket error when connecting to the WLC. Still troubleshooting this.
2. Possible issues with paging (see [netmiko issue](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko/issues/66).)
