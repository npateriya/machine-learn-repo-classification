# Automatically Connect to Cisco VPN + DUO

This collection of scripts helps automate connecting to VPN networks via CISCO's VPN Anyconnect utility protected by DUO two-factor authentication.

## On OSX
The Applescript (tested on OSX El Capitan 10.11.6) retreives the password from the OSX Keychain (specifically, from an entry named 'cisco_vpn') and instructs Duo to send a push notification to your smartphone.

### Installation
1. Create a new generic password entry in Keychain Access called "cisco_vpn" (the name in Keychain access must match that in line 39 below) with your password for the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server. So this entry should have Name: cisco_vpn, and Account: cisco_vpn
2. Open this script in Script Editor (both this and the above are in the Applications->Utilities folder) and "Save as.." an Application (.app) with name: "Automatic_Anyconnect".
3. Open Security & Privacy System Preferences, go to Privacy, Accessibility.
4. Enable the above .app so it can access Accessibility
5. Copy and paste a nice icon on the generic Applescript icon (I used a copy of the default AnyConnect one)
6. Add the new .app to /Users/[yourshortname]/Applications with a shortcut to your Dock 
7. Enjoy the fast connection with no need to enter password and increased security of not having a sensitive password stored as plain text
8. Run script again to close connection

Note: You can run this app either using Spotlight (Cmd + Spacebar, followed by typing the apps name) or by typing `open -a Automatic_Anyconnect` into a terminal window.

## On Windows 10

The Visual Basic Script (tested on Windows 10 Anniversary Update) unfortunately stores the password in plain text within the script (a terrible thing to do really - use at your own risk) and instructs DUO to call you on your secondary phone number ('phone2').

2. Change the password
