Cisco UCM call detail report - Python Flask.

The aim of the project is to provide web interface for call details.
The cron script parses CDR files from FTP directory and puts values to MySQL database.

First of all, you need to configure CUCM to export CDR files into FTP directory.
Then put /scripts/csv2sql.py on CRON. Make sure that database gets filled.
