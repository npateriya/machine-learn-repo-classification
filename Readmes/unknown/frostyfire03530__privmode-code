privmode-code
=============

Privmode Code will let a user type in the hexadecimal values from the eprom from a Cisco device and compute the "priv" password for the device. I created Privmode Code to try my hand at writing C# and using the SDK SharpDevelop. Algorithm credits go to: Roman S. Emelyanov (http://ers.msk.ru/)
