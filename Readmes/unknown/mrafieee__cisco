CCNA & CCNP Scnarios
---------------------

my files has been categorized in two main sections which are seperated by the tools I have used for simulations 
* Cisco Packet Tracer
* GNS3

my documentation and notes over CCNA and CCNP are moved to https://github.com/mrafieee/notes
I like GNS3 much more because it is opensource and can be found easily but for some L2 scnarios I needed Packet tracer.

I hope this repo can be useful for you as well.
