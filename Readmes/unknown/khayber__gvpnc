This tool provides a GUI for the vpnc command. I created it in Glade, Python, and PyGTK a few years ago, but use it almost every day to VPN into my office on Ubuntu Linux. You can likely use it on any version of Linux with a GUI.

I've posted this here because I really want others to copy it and improve upon it -- I simply don't have enough time and energy to extend this.

*(2010/6/7)*

As of today, I (khayber) have taken up the challenge of improving and maintaining gvpnc.  SuperMike gave me Administrator access here and I've started updating things.

The first thing I did was fix the 2 open issues (really the same thing) and release version 1.02.

I also have quite a lot of changes in the source repository and I'll make a new release soon.  Stay tuned...
