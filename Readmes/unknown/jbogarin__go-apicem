## Usage

You need to create a YAML file in your home directory or give one to *apicem* using the --config flag. If the file is in the home directory it should be in the following path $HOME/.apicem.yaml

The example is at apicem.yaml.example

Once you have the URL and ticket configured, you can go ahead and start using the CLI tool.

You can generate the ticket using:

```shell
apicem ticket -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSwORD>

apicem host list
apicem network-device list -s all
apicem network-device count -s all
```
