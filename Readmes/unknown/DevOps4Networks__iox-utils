# IOx Utilities

In the course of working with Cisco's IOx, there are various actions, command sets, processes and so on that I found 
myself repeating.

I am coding those here, mainly in Python, for future posterity.

## Initial Configuration of Devices via a Serial Port

The minimum connectivity that always has to be available to a device is via one of the serial ports with a console 
cable. From that point it possible to install images, load configurations and generally do what is required to 
get the device to a state where IOS and the IOx GOS have IP connectivity and can be accessed via other management
interfaces over IP.

The scripts in the [pyserial_util](./pyserial_util) directory automate common tasks when configuring a device via a
serial console.
