# cisco-test

I have created a maven project using github api, imported in the dependency to interact with GitHub.

Due to the simplicity of the task I have created only one class with a main.
 
This class need as input the GitHub credentials (that I will send you via mail) and create an instance of the class GitHub.

Through this class I am able to retrieve the target repository and check for every pull request if is present a comment structured as: @bot say-hello.

If is present at least a comment of this kind I answer with: hello world.

The target repository is the same in which the project is pushed.
