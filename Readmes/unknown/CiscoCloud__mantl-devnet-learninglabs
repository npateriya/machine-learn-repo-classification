Self paced interactive Learning Labs for [DevNet Learning Labs](learninglabs.cisco.com).

## Mantl: Deploying applications into Marathon

Learn how to deploy applications in Marathon, which is running inside of Mesos (as a Mesos framework). First we will create a very basic web server. Next, we will pull down a Docker container and deploy it on Marathon. In each case, we will be using the Marathon REST API to manage the application lifecycles.
