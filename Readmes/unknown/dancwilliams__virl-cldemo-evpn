Demo EVPN on Cumulus Linux
========================
This project is based on the Cumulus Networks EVPN DEMO Located [HERE](https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo-evpn).  I have just adapted the configs to be rolled out into a VIRL topology to ease testing with other network devices.  A lot of the work was already done by Cumulus and it is great!  If there are any suggestions to make this better let me know!

This Github repository contains the configuration files necessary for setting up EVPN (Ethernet VPN) using Cumulus Linux and Quagga on the [Reference Topology](https://github.com/dancwilliams/virl-cldemo-evpn).  Only Server01->Server04, Leaf01->Leaf04 and Spine01->Spine02 are used.

The flatfiles in this repository will set up a BGP unnumbered routing fabric between the leafs and spines, and will trunks between switches and the servers in that rack.

Setting up CumulusVX to run in Cisco VIRL
-----------------------------------------

Quickstart: Run the demo
------------------------
    git clone https://github.com/cumulusnetworks/cldemo-evpn
    cd cldemo-evpn
    vagrant up oob-mgmt-server oob-mgmt-switch 
    vagrant up leaf01 leaf02 leaf03 leaf04 spine01 spine02 server01 server02 server03 server04
    vagrant ssh oob-mgmt-server
    sudo su - cumulus
    ssh server01
    ping 172.16.1.104

Requirements
----------------------
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) 

and

[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Downloads)

Factory-reset a device
----------------------
    vagrant destroy -f leaf01
    vagrant up leaf01

Destroy the entire topology
---------------------------
    vagrant destroy -f

KVM Support
---------------------------
By default this Vagrantfile is setup for Virtualbox.  To use this Demo for KVM use the Vagrantfile-kvm

    mv Vagrantfile-kvm Vagrantfile

All other directions remain the same

Detailed Instructions and Documentation 
---------------------------------------
[EVPN Documentation](https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/display/DOCS/Ethernet+Virtual+Private+Network+-+EVPN)
The EVPN Documentation was built around this demo and makes walking through this demo a breeze.  Please report problems with this demo using the "issues" tab above.

### Cumulus Linux
---------------------------------------
Cumulus Linux is a software distribution that runs on top of industry standard networking hardware. It enables the latest Linux applications and automation tools on networking gear while delivering new levels of innovation and ï¬‚exibility to the data center.

### Virtualizing a Network with Cumulus VX
---------------------------------------
[Cumulus VX](https://cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-vx/) is a virtual machine
produced by Cumulus Networks to simulate the user experience of configuring a
switch using the Cumulus Linux network operating system.
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is an open source tool for quickly
deploying large topologies of virtual machines. Vagrant and Cumulus VX can be
used together to build virtual simulations of production networks to validate
configurations, develop automation code, and simulate failure scenarios.

Vagrant topologies are described in a Vagrantfile, which is a Ruby program that
tells Vagrant which devices to create and how to configure their networks.
`vagrant up` will execute the Vagrantfile and create the reference topology
using Virtualbox. It will also use Ansible to configure the out-of-band
management network.
