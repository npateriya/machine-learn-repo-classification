This script is to assist in populating a CSV file for use with Cisco Prime
Infrastructure. Prime can push templates (scripts) out to configure devices
but the variables required by those scripts must be obtained from the devices
prior to execution. This script gathers the required information from devices
and populates the file so that the templates can work.

To start, log into Prime and select the template you wish to deploy and the
devices to push to. Open the CSV file in Excel and save it as an .xlsx file.
Add a second tab to the workbook and create two column headers, "Variables"
and "Commands". In these columns, place the variables from the first tab,
and the command that will produce the output that variable stores.
