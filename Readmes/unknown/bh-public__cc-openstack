# cc-openstack
This is a service to stand up openstack using packstack.
We have 3 main portions of the install
  
* service install  
* service configure  
* service start  
  
* service install - installs the openstack bits, packstack and needed packages  
* service configure - uses packstack to make an answer file then we edit it with sed and also edit a ssh.conf to allow root  
* service start - runs packstack to install openstack and also edits the horizon vhost file and populates the opensack public IP
