# Status Light for Cisco Spark

## Description

This is a status light, built on an ESP8266 and an Adafruit NeoPixel ring.
Every second, it queries the Cisco Spark API for your current status -
Active, Inactive, or Do Not Disturb - and changes the animation on the ring to match.

## Installation

Edit the file to include your Cisco Spark developer token at the top of the file.
This token can be retrieved by signing into [Cisco Spark Developer](https://developer.ciscospark.com)
and clicking on your picture at the upper right. Save the file and write it to your ESP8266.

The NeoPixel ring should be attached to pin D2 (GPIO4) on the ESP module along
with appropriate power and ground.
