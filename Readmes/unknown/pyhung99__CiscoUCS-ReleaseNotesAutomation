Cisco Release Notes Automation

This is the staging area for Release Notes Automation for Cisco Systems software.
This python script does the following:
  1. Reads in a csv file generated from Cisco's defect management system
  2. Finds the first software build where the defect occurs
  3. Reports where the defect is fixed
  4. Generates a structured XML file that can be imported into the Cisco.com publishing system.
