go get -u github.com/tmm3/parcli
# Model
Parcli builds a data structure from a cisco ios-style cli *runnning-config* using a relational data model. By leveraging this model, together with the provided methods, parcli enables the ability to easily parse data from thousands of configs. 
```
parent
 child
  grandchild
```

# Example
Simply define your data set, scope, and keyword - partial match is default w/ optional regex for exact or variable match.
```go
package main

import "github.com/tmm3/parcli"

func main() {
        //read in config lines
        config := parcli.New(cfg)
        //return all policy-maps that contain class P1
        p_w_c  := config.ParentsWithChild("policy-map", "^class.P1$")
        //return all policy-maps that don't contain class P1
        p_wo_c := config.ParentsWithOutChild("policy-map", "^class.P1$")
}
```
