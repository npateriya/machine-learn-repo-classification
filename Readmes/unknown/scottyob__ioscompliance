ioscompliance
=============

Little library that can perform compliance checks on Cisco IOS Devicee.

To use, first build a class that is used to check the config on each device.  This should
inherit ComplianceCheck.  See class information for details.

This project depends on https://github.com/scottyob/pyiosdevice
