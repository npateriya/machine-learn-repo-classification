# __Cisco Live 2017 - DEVNET-1223__
Workshop: Automating IOS-XR with Ansible

The workshop is meant to be a basic introduction to using Ansible with IOS-XR. It includes
how to set up IOS-XR to allow Ansible access (primarily to the console/exec CLI), an
overview of the existing Ansible iosxr_* modules, and an intro to the possibility of using
the YANG Development Kit (YDK) in custom Ansible modules.

Most of the contents of this repo are available via the *tithomas1/cl17devnet1223* container
on the Docker Hub. To experiment with an actual IOS-XR instance (VM or physical), the inventory
in the container is pre-built to include an *xr621* host. You can map a target IP for that host
into the container and launch in Docker with:

```commandline
docker run -it --rm --network=host --add-host xr621:<ip address> tithomas1/cl17devnet1223
```

## Setting up IOS-XR to allow Ansible

If not done already, generate crypto keys on the target IOS-XR device:

```commandline
crypto key generate rsa
```

Enable SSH version 2 and set a reasonable timeout:

```commandline
config t
  ssh version v2
  ssh timeout 120
  commit
  exit
```

This should be enough to try a simple command from your Ansible host. Make sure the target
device is already defined in your inventory. In this case, we'll use the *raw* command as
a test to pass a command over SSH to the IOS-XR CLI and dump the output. The `-u` parameter
specifies the SSH username, the `-k` parameter will trigger a prompt for the SSH password,
the `-m` specifies to use the *raw* command, and the `-a` provides the arguments to the
command/module.

```commandline
ansible <host> -u <username> -k -m raw -a "show version"
```

The first time you'll have to accept the SSH keys. You can also set up IOS-XR to use
certificate-based authentication for SSH, but that's outside the scope of this README at
the moment.

### Example playbooks
Set an SNMP community string:
```commandline
ansible-playbook playbooks/set-snmpv2.yaml --extra-vars="community=cisco123‚Äù
```
Create a new user account:
```commandline
ansible-playbook playbooks/create_user.yaml --extra-vars="newuser=bob password=cisco"
```
Delete an existing user:
```commandline
ansible-playbook playbooks/delete_user.yaml --extra-vars="user=bob"
```

## Setting up IOS-XR to allow NETCONF access (for YDK)

Allow NETCONF over SSH:

```commandline
config t
  ssh server netconf vrf default
  ssh server netconf port 830
  netconf-yang agent ssh
  commit
  exit
```

## Using YDK-Gen to create custom APIs

YDK's `generate` tool can be used to create custom/targeted APIs for specific use cases. Or it
might also be needed if a particular model isn't included in what comes with YDK (like the
IETF or OpenConfig models). I ended up needing to do my own because the OpenConfig interfaces
model wasn't included.

First, you need some tools on a build server. I used Ubuntu 16.04:

```commandline
sudo apt-get install python-pip zlib1g-dev python-lxml libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev libboost-dev libboost-python-dev \
  libssh-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libtool-bin libboost-all-dev libboost-log-dev libpcre3-dev libpcre++-dev libtool pkg-config \
  python3-dev python3-lxml cmake
```

Then you need to clone the YDK-Gen repository to a location on that server:

```commandline
mkdir -p ~/projects/ydk
cd ~/projects/ydk
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-gen
cd ydk-gen
```

Doing this in a virtual environment is not a bad idea. If you want to use the generated API
for an Ansible module, then it will need to be present in the global package list. We'll get
to more on that later.

```commandline
virtualenv -p python2.7 venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Install YDK-Gen's module dependencies into the virtual environment (this will take a bit):

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now `generate` should work. As a test:

```commandline
./generate.py --help
```
Generate the core API and install it:

```commandline
./generate.py --python --core
pip install gen-api/python/ydk/dist/ydk*.tar.gz
```
Create an API bundle description. You can use the OSPF or MACsec ones included in this repository as examples:

```commandline
vi profiles/bundles/ciscolive-ansible-ospf.json
```
Now we're ready to generate an API from the bundle description:

```commandline
./generate.py --python --bundle profiles/bundles/ciscolive-ansible-ospf.json
```
You can install the generated API into the virtual environment as a test or if you're planning to use the
API for something other than Ansible:

```commandline
pip install gen-api/python/ciscolive_ansible_ospf-bundle/dist/ydk*.tar.gz
```
If you're ready to try Ansible + YDK, you'll need to back out of the virtual environment and install YDK
and your custom API (if any) into the global package list. Ansible doesn't pick up the "hooks" needed to
be aware of the virtual environment, therefore you have to use the global list:

```commandline
deactivate
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo pip install gen-api/python/ydk/dist/ydk*.tar.gz
sudo pip install gen-api/python/ciscolive_ansible_ospf-bundle/dist/ydk*.tar.gz
```
