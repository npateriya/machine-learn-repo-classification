# 6ixParkApp (for ANDROID)
6ixPark - an app to save time and money when parking in the busy streets of Toronto. Second Place at Cisco / DevNet Hackathon!

IDEA: 

The user is able to find open parking spots in the city to save time rather than driving around looking for an open one. 
He or she is able to top up parking time (by text message) instead of going down and putting change into the classic meters. 
This also helps law enforcement officers keep track of who's time is up and can easily charge their account directly instead of placing tickets on the dashboard. 
Lastly, the user gets text messages (or notifications as preferred) periodically reminding them to move the car or top up to avoid charges. 

This app was created within a span of 12 hours for the CISCO hackathon so app is not fully functional. In addition, features such as TROPO - by CISCO that are used in the app to send text messages may also have ended their trial period. 

End.
