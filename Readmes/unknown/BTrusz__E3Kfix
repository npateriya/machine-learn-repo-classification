Cisco/Linksys E3000 Session Bug Workaround: "Editing anything in setup kicks me out with session failure"
https://community.linksys.com/t5/Wireless-Routers/Linksys-E1200-firmware-2-0-07-bug-editing-anything-in-setup/m-p/974084#M309702

This script fixes the crippling session error on submit bug that occurs when attempting to change storage-related settings.  This script was built under TamperMonkey 2.7 and tested with Google Chrome 58.0.3029.110 (64-bit) on my very own crappy Cisco/Linksys E3000 (Firmware Version: 1.0.06), your mileage may vary.

THIS SCRIPT MUST BE ACTIVE ON *EVERY* ROUTER PAGE to properly capture all events!!!!!
( Not just Share_Properties.asp*, FTP_Share_Access.asp*, Media_Share_Access.asp* )


CONFIGURATION: Add your router's IP address to the following line:

// @match        http://YourRoutersIPaddress/*
