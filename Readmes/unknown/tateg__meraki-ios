# Meraki IOS

This is a clone of the legendary Cisco IOS command line adapted for use with the Meraki Dashboard API.  This emulates the IOS interpreter and passes commands directly to the API.  All you need is an API key and access to the internet.

Basic usage:
- Run in interactive mode or pass in arguments
- - Interactive:
- - - Supply API key, Organization ID, Network ID and device serial number by following prompts
- - Arguments:
- - - 0 = API key
- - - 1 = Organization ID
- - - 2 = Network ID
- - - 3 = Device serial number


The actual interpreter is still very much a work in progress.  Basic error handling and CLI arguments have been implemented.
