# ciscojabber-hue-integration
This application integrates Cisco Jabber for Windows with a Philips Hue controller. The application is leverages Javascript in a custom tab in the Cisco Jabber application to send a command to the lights when I either receive a call or place a call. Once the call is finished, the lights turn off.

To use: Host the files on a local web server, changing the IP addressing and username on the Hue Controller. Once the site is active, you can add the Tab to Jabber.
