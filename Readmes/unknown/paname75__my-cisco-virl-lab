This is my basic VIRL test stuff 

inline_cfg_patch - patch to vmcloud.py to accept inline config. 


INE_Virl - INE lab in IOSv format

upload all lab folders to your ONEPK all in one instance:

launch from folder with :

cd <labname>
./startlab.sh
  

end lab with:
./stoplab.sh

you need the OnePK Virtual Machine from Cisco:
