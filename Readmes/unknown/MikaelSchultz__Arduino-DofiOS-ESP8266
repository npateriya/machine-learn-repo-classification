# DofiOS-ESP8266
An extensible Cisco like Shell for Arduino (ESP8266).

## Introduction
This is a library for Arduino (specifically the ESP8266 chip) that has a built-in telnet server you can connect to in order to execute pre defined and user defined commands.

You can add your own groups and commands to the menu system. See the example files.

In the image below a user defined group **maingroup** has been added.

## Features
The system has three main features.

### Question Mark (**?**)
You can always press the **?** key to get help in the current context (*see **red arrow** in image above*). This is very powerful, give it a try!

### Tab compleation
There is full support for tab completion.

If you press the TAB key, the command you are currently writing will be completed for you as much as possible.

### Partial command execution
The commands typed doesn't have to be complete.

Say you want to run `show version`.

You can as easily just type `sh ve` or `s v` provided there is only one match for these commands.

## Command Parameters
**Static** parameters passed to a command is printed "as is" in the help text.<br>
**Example**: true, false or none

**Variable** parameters passed to a command is printed as their name with 
curly brackets around them.<br>
**Example**: {ssid}, {passphrase} or {hostname}

Parameters that can have multiple values are separated with a pipe character: |

### Example
Command: `configure ap passphrase none|{passphrase} <cr>`

The command `configure ap passphrase` has one parameter that can be **none** or **{passphrase}**:
```
configure ap passphrase none
configure ap passphrase MySecretPass!
```

## Command Reference

These are the built-in commands that are available out of the box.
Every command is appended with \<cr\> indicating that it has no more parameters and
that Carriage Return should be pressed to execute the command.

#### Enable or disable the on-board access point
```
configure ap enabled true|false <cr>
```

This can only be set once the access point has been enabled.
```
configure ap passphrase none|{passphrase} <cr>
```

#### Set the SSID for the access point
This can only be set once the access point has been enabled.
```
configure ap ssid {ssid} <cr>
```

#### Enable or disable auto-connect
If the value is set
to true the WiFi station will automatically try
to connect to the access point in the saved configuration.
```
configure station auto-connect true|false <cr>
```
