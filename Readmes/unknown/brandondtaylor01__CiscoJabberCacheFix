# Cisco Jabber Cache Fix

Currently, there is an issue with Cisco Jabber in that once an existing directory number in <b>CUCM</b> is re-assigned to another profile, or another user, the old contact remains while the new contact is added. The issue is that there is a file in which Cisco Jabber maintains the contact cache. Sadly, the only solution is to delete this file.

This has caused a lot of frustration with me and my company, and I've written this small <i>GOLANG</i> tool to remove the offending file. Simply run this tool (Administrator priviledges may or may not be needed), and the issue will be resolved.

<h4>How do I know if I'm affected?</h4>
- When you, or someone you know call someone via Cisco Jabber, does it show up as the previous owner of that extension?
- Do voicemails show that person?
- When calling from a physical Cisco IP phone, does your name show correctly on the remote phone?

If you answered "yes" to any of the above, then you are affected.
