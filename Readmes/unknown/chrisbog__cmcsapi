#### CMCS API Query

##### Description
This python application queries the Cisco CMCS Service for detailed inventory data.

Cisco CMCS is described at:
[Cisco CMCS](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/analytics-automation-software/compliance-management-configuration-platform/index.html)

Cisco Compliance Management and Configuration Platform helps customers understand and control organizational, commercial, and regulatory compliance across their entire network by assessing and remediating outdated and inaccurate software images and configurations to achieve and then maintain ongoing compliance and configuration standards. 

The Cisco CMCS Platform has a very full featured API.   The API Documentation has to be obtained from your Cisco SE or AM.  It is not publicly available online.

However, the CMCS API uses XML Queries.   This is a little different from most REST APIs.

This application is interesting since it shows the proper way of formatting XML Queries to be used for REST API Calls.

##### Configuration
The application uses a configuration file called cmcsapi.ini.  The cmcsapi.ini file has the following three items required for configuration.

* ***username***- This configuration item specifies the username that can be used to query CMCS
* ***password*** - This item specifies the password for the account specified by username above
* ***cmcs_api*** - This item specifies the IP Address of the CMCS Server
