# My road to the cisco certification <br />
I bought and I am using real lab, including the following: <br />
3 routers: Cisco 2620XM (128 MO RAM; 32 MO System Flash under IOS Advanced enterprise 12.4(3)) + 3x WIC-1T. <br />
3 switchs: Cisco C2950 (under IOS Version 12.1(22)EA6) <br />
 <br />
Password and mac addresses are omitted in config files, and the simple "cisco" password is used in packet tracer files. <br />

## Goal of this repository
These small projects help me to prepare for the certification. <br />
I upload every config file and blueprint that I have made because it may be useful to me later on.
