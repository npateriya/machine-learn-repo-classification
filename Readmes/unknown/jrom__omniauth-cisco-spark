# OmniAuth Cisco Spark Strategy


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-cisco-spark'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

To develop an integration with Cisco Spark we first need an OAuth2 application
registered. It can be done
[here](https://developer.ciscospark.com/add-app.html) but I recommend start by
reading the [Getting
Started](https://developer.ciscospark.com/getting-started.html).

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/jrom/omniauth-cisco-spark.


## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
