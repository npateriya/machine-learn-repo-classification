# nxapi
Sample scripts for Cisco's NxOS REST API (NXAPI) - object model version

Those scripts are meant to be executed off the box (on a Linux machine, PC, MAC, etc.)
and assume you have enabled feature nxapi on the NxOS target device

The scripts also assume you have NxOS 6.2 or higher (Nexus 9000) as they make object-model
requests, not CLi/JSON-RPC requests.
