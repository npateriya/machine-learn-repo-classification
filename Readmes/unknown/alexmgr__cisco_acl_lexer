cisco_acl_lexer
===============

A rough lexer for cisco ACLs. Allows to validate ACLs offline to avoid typos.

Usage: ./acl < file_with_acls
L4 ACL is valid (action permit)
IP ACL is valid (action permit)
L4 ACL is valid (action deny)
Line 4: syntax error, unexpected TOKMASK6, expecting TOKHOST or TOKIPADDR6 at /64
