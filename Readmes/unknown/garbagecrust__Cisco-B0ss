Make the router your bitch. Requires AutoHotKey

Instructions: 

1. Router reset script

  connect via telnet or console

  press Ctrl + Alt + 1 to trigger the script
  
  Please for the love of %DEITY% keep the Putty or CMD window selected. The last thing you want is a rogue macro... Seriously, when you run these scripts just don't touch the keyboard or mouse until they're done. Trust me, things get weird. 
  
  When done, the router will reboot. Usually takes around 30-40 seconds

2. Basic setup script
  
  connect via console

  Press Ctrl + Alt + 2
  
  wait for around three seconds
  
3. Config Exporter
  
  Connect via Telnet in CMD.EXE
  
  Press Ctrl + Alt + 3

  When the script is done, save the file

4. Subnetting

  simply press the digits consisting of the network prefix length in order on the numpad
  
  for prefixes with duplicate numbers, press the first one on the numpad and the second on the keyboard
  
  note that this does break the numpad for normal operations, and you should really kill the script when you don't need it running.
