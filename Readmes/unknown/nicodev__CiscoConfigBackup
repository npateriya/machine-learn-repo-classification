CiscoConfigBackup
=================

bash script to backup cisco devices configs. Each time you save a new config, the script with save a copy of the Cisco's start-config with the date. If the a config has already been save the same day, the script will add a number.
The script will also display a diff between the newly saved config and the previous one.


Usage :

CiscoConfigBackup "name of device" 

NOTE: "name of device" is normally the hostname. You need to setup a dns or update the hosts file to use hostname.

Then you will need to enter your creds for the Cisco device. The script will then connect to the device via telnet and copy the start-config.



configbackup-cron
=================

This script run as a cronjob will check if new config have been saved and will make a full backup as tgz file and save it to SMB folder. You will need a SAMBA server or a Window's share to use it.


Example of cronjob (this one will run hourly and send a confirmation email when it is done) :

SHELL=/bin/bash

MAILTO=mailaddress

0 * * * * root /usr/local/bin/configbackup-cron "SAMBA IP address" "samba credential file" "share folder"



The cred file format is as follow :

domain=DOMAIN

username=username

password=password


IMPORTANT: make sure to restrict the file permission. Ideally, create a backup account for this purpose only.
