### Foodwagon plans your outings for you.
Ever have problems in the office trying to decide on where to go for lunch? 

Want to try a new place but you aren't sure who's interested? 

Simply create a FoodWagon in the channel and see who bandwagons along! You can even request a minimum number of people to come along for an event to happen (Such as a 5-person buffet). 

### No more clutter
Stop sorting through tons of spam in a `#food` channel. See all the upcoming plans and easy pick which you want to join. 

Nobody knows where to go? Grab a random restaurant from the suggestions!
