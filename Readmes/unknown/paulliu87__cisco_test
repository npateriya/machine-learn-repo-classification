## What is the problem ?


We're ordering meals for a team lunch. Every member in the team needs one meal, some have dietary restrictions such as vegetarian, gluten free, nut free, and fish free. We have a list of restaurants which serve meals that satisfy some of these restrictions. Each restaurant has a rating, and a limited amount of meals in stock that they can make today. Implement an object oriented system with automated tests that can automatically produce the best possible meal orders with reasonable assumptions.

Example:
 
Team needs: total 50 meals including 5 vegetarians and 7 gluten free.
Restaurants: Restaurant A has a rating of 5/5 and can serve 40 meals including 4 vegetarians, 
Restaurant B has a rating of 3/5 and can serve 100 meals including 20 vegetarians, and 20 gluten free.

## What have I done to it ?

I made a web app to allow customers place order online. The App will provide the best combination through all available restaurants.

<a name="algorithsm"/>
## What is the Algorithsm ?

Iterate through an array of restaurants, sort them by, rating, type of food and amount of food they provid. Once order is placed, a list of order information is provided base on the rank of restaurants.

## How to use it ?

First clone repo to your computer.

```ruby

git clone https://github.com/paulliu87/cisco_test

```

If there is a problem regarding git source, please run:

```ruby

bundler update

```

This should solve the problem. 

Once the clone is on your local computer, run migration

```ruby

rails db:migrate

```

To reset the database and seed it( only for testing)

```ruby

rails db:drop
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

```

Now, start the server:

```ruby

cisco_test (master *) :> rails s
/Users/pengliu/.rbenv/versions/2.4.0/lib/ruby/gems/2.4.0/gems/activesupport-5.0.1/lib/active_support/xml_mini.rb:51: warning: constant ::Fixnum is deprecated
/Users/pengliu/.rbenv/versions/2.4.0/lib/ruby/gems/2.4.0/gems/activesupport-5.0.1/lib/active_support/xml_mini.rb:52: warning: constant ::Bignum is deprecated

```

Now, open a browser, and enter localhost:3000, you will see the root page of the webapp, click on Restaurants to view the available restaurants or create  a new one. Once the enough restaurant are created, click on Lunchorder and create a lunchorder. When a lunchorder is created, click on place order to get the results.
