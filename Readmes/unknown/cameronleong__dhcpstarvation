# dhcpstarvation
dhcp starvation attack tool with cisco port security evasion


Done for research and educational purposes; to understand the weaknesses of cisco switches. Do not abuse.

One script is multithreaded for faster starvation but that doesn't comply to RFC standards (as an attacker i guess it doesn't matter)

WIP, explanation coming soon
