# cisco-jam-strings
This was a challenge I was given when I went to the Cisco Jam in Galway in 2017.
I was put on a team and had to write code that matched the docstrings in `challenge1.py` and passed the provided tests in `test_challenge1.py`.

Originally one of my team members wrote `taskTwo_sort_list(unorderedList)`, but I rewrote it for GitHub.
I also corrected a few minor mistakes.
