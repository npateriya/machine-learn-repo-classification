netmask_to_ios-wildcard.py is a script that will search through a file, locating normal network masks, then invert them into Cisco IOS wildcard masks.

This script is written for ease of use in macOS and Linux, however, it can be modified to use a Desktop path in Windows.  I have not implemented that capability.

In order to use this script, follow these steps:

1) Place the file that you wish to change the normal network masks to Cisco IOS wildcard network masks on your macOS or Linux desktop directory (~/Desktop) and ensure that the file name is InvertMe.txt (case sensitive).

2) Run the following command in your Terminal/local shell:

netmask_to_ios-wildcard.py

3) The script will parse through the file, change the network masks and save the changes to a new file on your macOS or Linux desktop directory (~/Desktop) named Inverted.txt (case sensitive).  This way, the script doesn't modify the contents of the original file.
