I've decided to split this into 2 repos, one for [the Vagrant setup](https://github.com/bordeltabernacle/ansible_networking_vagrant_setup), the other
with all my [proof of concept playbooks](https://github.com/bordeltabernacle/ansible_network_automation_poc) in.

So, I'm gonna leave this repo as is, and any updates will be in the above
mentioned repos instead.
