# iot-hackathon
This repository contains the contents worked on during the Cisco Cybersecuirty IoT hackathon

> This project was implemented to reduce electricity consumption in businesses and schools with the use of a Cisco Catalyst 3560-C Series Switch. 
> Items incorporated into the design are three sensors: pressure, sound, and distance. 

  > The pressure sensor would be installed on the surface of the desk.
  > The distance sensor would be either fixed on top of the desktop or near by in the cubical/office area. 
  > Lastly, the sound sensor would be positioned in the keyboard/mouse or near by, to detect noise.

> All three sensors will contribute to determining if a person is present at their workplace. 
> If a person is flagged as present, the light will remain on only in that area of the office, preventing overconsumption of electricity.
