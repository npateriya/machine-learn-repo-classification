# EnableSSH
A script to enable ssh on multiple Cisco devices.

 Use this script in conjunction with a Device Database csv file named DeviceDB.csv
 
This script is multithreaded. Ensure your processor can support this, if you are using a low end PC this could peg your processor.

I take no responsibility if you destory your PC, use this script at your own risk.
