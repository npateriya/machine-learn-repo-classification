# cisco-jam-stack
This was a challenge I was given in a team at the Cisco Jam event in Galway.
We had to follow the docstrings to write the methods in `CiscoJamStack.py` and to write the tests in `TestStack.py`.

I've rewritten the functions which were originally written by the other members of the team.
