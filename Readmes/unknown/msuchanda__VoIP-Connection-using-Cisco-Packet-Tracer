# VoIP Connection using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project uses Cisco packet tracer to simulate routers, switches and network connections.
There are 4 locations designed in the project which are connected to each other. 
After the project completion, it is possible to call any phone in any network from another phone anywhere in the network.
Project steps are as follows:
1. Powering on IP Phones.
2. Configuring switches.
3. Configuring routers.
4. Configuring DHCP server.
5. Configuring Call Manager Express (CME).
6. Configuring routing protocol (EIGRP used).
7. Configuring connections between locations.


The presentation file contains step-by-step description and screen-shots of how the project is developed, and completed.
