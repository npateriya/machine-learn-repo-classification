# org-slide

This is a quick script to create account team slides using Python. It won't
 work anyplace other than Cisco right now but I'll fix some of that as I
 move along here. Right now too many values are hard coded.

 It only works inside the Cisco firewall as well and doesn't handle failure
 conditions in any way.

    usage: app.py [-h] [--template TEMPLATE] [--master MASTER]
                username users [users ...]


    positional arguments:
      username             username to bind to LDAP with
      users                space separated CCO ids to add to the team

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help           show this help message and exit
      --template TEMPLATE  optional PowerPoint template to use.
      --master MASTER      master slide # to use in the template. no effect if
                           --template is not also supplied. defaults to 0.
