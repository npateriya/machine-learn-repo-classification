# aci-cyber-ingest
Create incident in Phantom Cyber from Cisco ACI

## Intended Audience
This code is the ACI app store component of a solution developed to demonstrate the integration of security automation (Phantom) with Ansible Tower. This app is intended to run on the APIC controller, monitoring atomic counters, which have been configured from Ansible, launched by Phantom, and generating a security incident (a container and artifacts in Phantom) when the counters have exceeded a configured threshold.

Review the documentation for more details on the total solution.
