# Cisco-config-gen
A Cisco IP phone config generator written in PHP

It's a very basic script made in like an hour, not designed to be fancy or well coded, just functional donâ€™t h8 on me for it ;(

Makes use of Foundation 5 (because 6 is quite broken in terms of js for equaliser)
Requires PHP 5 or later

Feel free to fork it and submit a pull request if you want to improve it, proberbly needs improving but just don't have time at the moment.


Future Additions
+ Multiple Extensions
+ Custom Dial Plans
+ Set Timezone and Format

But at the moment it does the following
+ First Extension
+ Voicemail (*98 as this is the default on asterisk systems)
+ And the phone label


This code is quite bad, deal with it :D
