=======

Python scripts for Cisco FC mds mgmt.  These scripts take input from a text file.  For deletions, each line of the input should be one alias or zone, e.g.,

aliasP1

aliasP2

for renames, each line will have two records, separated by a space.  You can modify the delimiter by changing the rstrip() function to look for whatever separator you choose. A sample input file looks like:

zOldName	zNewName

zOldZ1		zNewZ1

These scripts require the pexpect Python module.
