# SNMP-WLC
The TestClient solution is a testing and debugging project for returning information via SNMP.

The ClientTracker is a more functional project, including Hangfire for scheduling retrieval of SNMP data and dumping it into a MySql database. 
Inside the ClientTracker project there's also a .NET Core 1.1 web project for some basic display of charts.
