Serial Terminal
===============

This is a Serial Terminal for communication with Cisco / 3COM and other devices

Installation Notes:
===================

The easy way is to create a new project on Eclipse IDE or Netbeans IDE and add the source files and libraries :-P

The "Hard" way is to add it on Eclipse IDE as an existing project and re-built it. First you will need to configure
the classpath for the libraries. Just remove the existing libraries and re add jre system library and rxtxcomm.jar library.

Details on how to install rxtxlib on your system you can find here:

This project was built under java7u11 so i recomment on using oracle-java jdk,jre and not openJDK.

Finally if you want to remove all java directories from your computer and re install them (LINUX Users) follow the instruction from the file:

remove_java.txt
