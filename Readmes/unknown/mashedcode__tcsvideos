# tcsvideos

The Cisco TelePresence Content Server is annoying! Especially if you want to
watch videos on it and especially if you want to watch them in 2x speed and
especially if you want to watch not just one of them and especially if the
videos are divided in topics and you may only want to watch one of the topics.

Give the power back to the user!

#### 1. Install the executable.
```
python3 setup.py install --user
```
#### 2. Setup an sqlite database with the schema that is available in the repository.
```
sqlite3 ./metadata.db < ./schema.sql
```

#### 3. Configure a [config file](example.yml).

#### 4. Make sure your destination directory exists.
```
mkdir -p ~/multimedia/tcsvideos/
```

#### 5. Download all videos. (You probably don't want to do that)
```
tcsvideos ./tcsconfig.yml '%'
```

I don't look forward to extend or maintain this project. Therefore maintainers
are welcome!

## TODO
