Analyze CiscoReady output for wireless deployed at your customer broken into ac, n and g access point counts

This script is intended for Cisco Systems Engineers with access to the (internal) Cisco Ready website

Cisco Ready has good data on shipped hardware at our customers, but the data is not easy to mine and analyze.  This tool quickly parses through the data to answer question about deployment of wireless APs at your customer.

If I get good feedback I'll make a better tool to analyze questions like "what are Cat 2k vs 3k/4k sales at your account",  "what percentage of sales are done with CiscoOne vs total eligible products for CiscoOne", "Your customer has % UC endpoints with / without video",   "your customer's UCS as a percentage of their IT budget / Cisco Spend".  So send me feedback.  neaga <at> cisco .
