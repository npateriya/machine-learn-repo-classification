# The-World-s-first-CCIE-Family.
The World’s first CCIE Family. Cisco Certified Internetwork Experts (CCIE) is very hard to come by.  Did you know that less than 1% of professional networkers hold this qualification?  You think this is extraordinary?  How about having nine, yes you heard me correctly, nine CCIE’s in one family!  The cycle was completed when Roshana, mother of Rizni and wife of Harith Kariapper, passed this gruelling eight hour lab exam in January 2016, achieving this exceptional accolade of being the world’s first CCIE family.  What an achievement for this forty seven year old mother of three! Roshana, daughter of the famous gynaecologist Dr. A.L.M. Jameel, did not follow her father’s footsteps by studying medicine, although she obtained admission.  Instead she studied Accounts and Marketing and graduated from the Seneca College in Canada. She is a keen amateur painter.    But that is not the only accolade this family boasts of.  Son Rizni, currently a double CCIE, became the youngest CCIE in the world, at the age of 18 in 2011.  While most fifteen year olds were fantasizing about girls and pin up models, Rizni was preparing for his CCIE exams.  He also passed his eight hour lab exam on the first attempt. This talented youngster can add senior employment at multinational companies like Accenture, TELUS Communication and Managed 24/7 to his Curriculum Vitae.  Currently he is employed as a Senior Consultant at the Central Bank of Europe in Germany. Where does all this come from?  Obviously from proud father Harith, who is a hexa, that’s right, six times CCIE. But what does it mean to be a CCIE, or a double or even a Hexa CCIE?  Don’t think for a moment that this means taking the same two hour written and eight hour practical exams over and over again. To ensure unparalleled program quality and relevance value, CCIE continuously updates and revises its testing tools and methodologies.  Furthermore a CCIE can qualify in several different fields of expertise like Routing and Switching, Service Provider, Security, Call Collaboration, Data Centre and Wireless.  Currently the CCIE R/S eight hour lab exam consists of a two hour trouble shooting, thirty minutes diagnostic and a gruelling five and a half hours configuration exam. To pass you must not only meet or exceed the minimum score on all three modules, but your total score must meet the overall lab exam cut score.  Even if you have passed all three modules, you can still fail...unfair isn’t it?  You also need to make your first attempt within eighteen months after you have passed your two hour written exam.  And listen to this; if you fail to pass the lab test within three years after passing the written exam, you have to redo the written exam.  I am sure, you will agree, indeed an accomplishment to be called a CCIE. The leader of the pack, Harith Kariapper, is currently the Master Instructor of WinNET Systems in the UK (www.winnetsystems.co.uk ).  At WinNET he is responsible for the design of their Cisco programs as well as the conducting of all the CCIE boot camps. He has produced more than a thousand CCIE’s!  Don’t think for one moment that Harith was born with “The Silver Spoon in His Mouth”. Despite losing his father at the tender age of 18, and his mother three years later, he still graduated from the University of Peradeniya, with the help of his older brother, sister and brother in law. From the beginning of his career, the upliftment of fellow Sri Lankans was important to him. His venture, “MYOWN Computer Systems” with the help of “MYOWN Musthafa” established training facilities in all nine provinces of Sri Lanka.  He also pioneered computer studies for villages in Sri Lanka.  Unfortunately this noble initiative had to be abandoned because of the deteriorating economy and threats of the looming Civil War.  During his lustrous career, spanning more than twenty five years, he has worked with world renowned names like The Bank of America, designing and training networks.  FlexITy solutions, a gold partner of Cisco also utilized his expertise.  Managed 24/7, another Cisco Gold Partner is also on his career list. Where to now for this talented family?  I am sure that they will be welcomed in every country around the globe with open arms.  The contribution that they can bring is almost indescribable. Humbly, their future plans are to return home, to Sri Lanka, their place of origin, in September.  This lifelong dream can now become a reality for them.  The Sri Lanka civil war, which started in 1983, spanning more than 25 years, mercifully came to an end in 2009. But the political situation didn’t come to a stable position till present government being elected last year.  In Sri Lanka they are planning to plough back by opening a Cisco Training institute.  Imagine how many doors can now be opened for fellow Sri Lankans, who did not have access to this industry in the past. Not to lose touch with the industry, they also plan on opening a consulting firm, which can work with companies globally. With all this talent and determination, how can they not succeed!  We wish them well with their future endeavours!  You can visit www.winnetystems.co.uk to see their current UK operation. Also harith can be contacted by harith@winnetystems.co.uk .
