# network-inventory
Using Paramiko, a Python implementation of SSHv2 to pull serial numbers from a Cisco switch. The Python script will read a standard text file containing one IP address per line for each switch stack that needs to be inventoried. The script will then output the switch stack hostname and the serial numbers of each switch in the stack to a standard text file.

Items left to do:

1 - Add option to pull SNMP location data
2 - Add option to pull switch software version
3 - Create functions for each type of data pull
4 - Add user selectable options to allow choose of which data to pull
