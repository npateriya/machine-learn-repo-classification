Cisco Dialer - Chrome Extension
-------------------------------

Add to Chrome: Stable - http://goo.gl/yTXj10 or Beta - http://goo.gl/HHM2EP

Cisco Dialer adds a little phone icon behind every phone number within your Google Contacts to quickly dial a number on your Cisco based IP phone. The new version also supports dialing from any site or the context menu.

Just open the extension settings and add the address of your phone. Now open Google Mail and select Contacts. Select a contact and hover over a phone entry. You should now see a little phone icon. Click on it and your phone should start dialing the number. If you activate the option to make any number dialable on any site then you can hover over any supported number and a dial button should appear right next to the number. If you click on it your phone starts to dial.

Have Fun!

Tested with the Cisco SPA500 Series IP Phones but should also work on other Cisco IP based phones.
