# Cisco-Lunch-Connect
Lunch connect is an web-app to connect interns and new hires to senior managers from your group when they are free for lunch or coffee chats.

## Do you spend enough time interacting with people outside your team and learning more about other Cisco teams and groups? 
## Challenges
1. Cisco has a large group of diverse people working in different specialties. 
2. With employees on different projects and each subgroup with different backgrounds and training, organizational silos are a constant problem.
3. Interns donâ€™t get as many opportunities to learn about other groups and team.

We bring you Lunch Connect to help you use every single minute of your lunch networking, gaining visibility & exploring the work diversity at Cisco.
