BRKSDN_2935

This repository will be used for the Cisco Live Berlin  BRKSDN-2935 session.  

Software included: ERNA.py - full lab/POC code.

Network Programmability and Software Defined Networking (SDN) have changed the way network engineers look
at infrastructure and operations. Conversations about configuring networks are increasingly focused on
the new Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and less around the familiar Command Line Interface (CLI).

Many engineers have questions about how this can be applied to existing environments.

This session will showcase the use of the open REST API's available in

- APIC-EM
- Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI)
- Cisco UCS Director
- Spark
- Tropo

to dynamically provision secured remote access to Enterprise resources for a third party entity.
The code will configure firewalls, routers, switches, and Data Center compute resources.
