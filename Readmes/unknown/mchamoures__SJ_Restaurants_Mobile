# Cisco Restaurants

## Introduction

Welcome! This project aims to help teams pick restaurants around Cisco Systems, San Jose.

## Current status

[YAML](http://yaml.org/) is used in our day-to-day changes due to its readability. However, [JSON](http://www.json.org/) is used in our app for its Javascript integration. To facilitate this integration, `yamltojson.rb` converts our YAML to JSON. The `mobile/` folder uses [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) to make a mobile-friendly website that can be deployed on [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/). The `web/` folder uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to make a mobile-aware and web-oriented website.

## Guidelines

Here are a list of guidelines to help ensure the consistency and reliability of our records:

- Make all edits and changes in `restaurants.yml`
- If you add an attribute to a place, add an attribute to every other place
- If you add an entry, make sure every attribute is in place

Also, please check that these criteria are true before adding restaurants:

- 4+ stars and 30+ reviews on Yelp
- Recommended by other Cisco hires
- You would gladly recommend it to others
