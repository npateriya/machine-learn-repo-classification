# Nexus-HSRP-Template
Cisco Nexus HSRP Templates

This script takes input from a CSV file that contains VLAN id, VLAN description, and subnet address. The script then outputs a file for both the active and standby next switches. The script assumes /24 subnets and a HSRP IP of .1.

Make sure the .csv file is in the same directory as the script. The two output files will appear in the same directory. The files will be timestamped.
