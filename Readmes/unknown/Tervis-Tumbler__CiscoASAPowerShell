# CiscoASAPowerShell
Module for interacting with Cisco ASA via PowerShell


This module is based on using the ASA's ability to execute commands via web requests to URLs like https://your.asa.here/admin/exec/show+run

ASAs with code later than 9.3(2) can make use of the [rest api](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2921386/security0/digging-deeper-into-the-cisco-asa-firewall-rest-api.html).

This module doesn't currently use the rest API as I don't use an ASA that supports this but if you do then I would be happy to work with you on extending this module and then taking pull requests.

This module is not endorsed by Cisco or has any affiliation with Cisco.
