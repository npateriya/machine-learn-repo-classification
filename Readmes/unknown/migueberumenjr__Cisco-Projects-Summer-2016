These are the coding projects that I developed from scratch while interning in the Global Services Logistics and Operations group at Cisco

The RMA Advising Tool assists Technical Assistance Center (TAC) Engineers with advice on whether to conduct an RMA for an order placed by clients, based on a number of factors such as size of the order, repair flags, annual demand, stock, and countries in which the client is located. Written in HTML, CSS, D3.js, Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap.

vlookup-clone.py

The VLOOKUP Clone emulates the VLOOKUP function in Excel using Python. It grabs information from multiple Excel workbooks, documents relationships between columns, and transfers the data to a template required for uploading the data using a tool created by the department I interned under at Cisco. Currently only performs on one group of workbooks that are related. A future update will allow for performing the transfer with multiple groups of similar data/origin.
