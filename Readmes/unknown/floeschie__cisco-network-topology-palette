# Cisco Network Topology Palette

This repository provides a GraphML palette of Cisco's black/white network topology icons. It can be used in editors which support the GraphML format, such as [yED](http://yed.yworks.com/).

The icons were taken from [Cisco's Network Topology Icons page](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac50/ac47/2.html). According to this page, "Cisco icons are globally recognized and generally accepted as standard for network icon topologies. You may use them freely, but you may not alter them."
