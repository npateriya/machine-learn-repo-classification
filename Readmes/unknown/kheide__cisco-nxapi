# cisco-nxapi
a node.js wrapper / sdk for cisco nxapi

## IN DEVELOPMENT AND DOES NOT YET WORK (!) 

If you want to contribute please get in touch. 

## Why Node.JS when Cisco promotes usage of python?

If you are building a larger project python will just be a pain. If you just want a simple, dump script then use python by all means, but Node.JS is the future for client/server applications.  

If you havent heard about Node, then you should do yourself a favour and read up on it.


## Installation

Clone the repository and run 

```
npm install 
```

In your project do: 
```javascript
var NXapi = require('cisco-nxapi');

var mySwitches = new NXapi([
 {
   host: '10.10.10.10'
 },
 {
   host: '10.20.30.10'
 }
]);


// promise-based async call (because we dont want to wait and block io)
mySwitches.showVersion().then((response) => {
  // do what you want with the response
}, (error) => {
  // handle the error in whichever way you prefer.
}); 

```
