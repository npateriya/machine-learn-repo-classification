# anyconnectd
_Designed to keep an AnyConnect VPN connection always up_

This was originally configured for University of Wisconsin Whitewater's VPN service, but could be easily modifiable for use elsewhere. 

**STILL IN PROGRESS**

To set up:
``` bash
cd /opt && sudo git clone git@github.com:benyanke/anyconnectd.git && cd anyconnectd && sudo ./setup;
```
