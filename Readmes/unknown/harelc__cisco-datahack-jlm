Where to start:
*	http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index Anaconda might be your safest bet to install everything together. 
 *	It’s a full package and environment manager, read http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html 
*	or you can use pip (http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/) and then use it as a package manager with the whl files from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ 
 *	http://pydata.org/downloads/ useful links to many of the libraries

## Learning Resources

### Safari Books Online books
*	http://cisco.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/9781783988365 - scikit-learn focus, very good
*	http://cisco.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781783555130 - new one, a little advanced, but very practical
*	http://cisco.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781783981960 - pandas focus
*	http://cisco.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592 - data analysis (pandas and more) focus
*	http://cisco.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781784392772 - 2nd edition of one of the more famous books, lots of examples
*	http://cisco.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781785280429 - broad array of data science topics
*	http://cisco.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781783284818 - IPython, visualizations
*	http://cisco.safaribooksonline.com/book/information-technology-and-software-development/9781783989485 - somewhat more advanced scikit-learn ‘cookbook’
*	http://cisco.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781782161400 - yet another one, which I have as PDF
*	http://cisco.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/machine-learning/9781449330514 - ditto

### Udacity mini-courses
*	https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827 - this part covers the more basic stuff I think we probably know quite well
*	https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201 – this is a continuation of the previous course and covers more advanced material which I didn’t know too well like z-tests, t-tests, hypothesis testing etc.
*	https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775 – very well done but rather basic introduction to Git and GitHub
*	https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-and-d3js--ud507  – I just started but the topic is IMHO very interesting and important
*	https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-science--ud359 – the curriculum is pretty standard by now for this topic in MOOCs, haven’t really tried it out yet. 
*	https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120 - didn’t try it out yet

And then there are the videos of the course that accompanies the excellent ISL book:
