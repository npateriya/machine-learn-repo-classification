# Getting Started With OpenConfig in Cisco IOS XR
This repository includes guides to get started with [OpenConfig](http://www.openconfig.net/) models on Cisco IOS XR devices. OpenConfig is a group of network operators that are developing common data models for network configuration and management in cooperation with vendors.  Cisco IOS XR started introducing support for OpenConfig models in release 5.3.2.  Each model directory in this repository includes a guide to get started using the model, along with configuration and operational examples.  You can use NETCONF or [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) to use OpenConfig models with a Cisco IOS XR device.
