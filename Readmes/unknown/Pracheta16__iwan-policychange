# iwan-policychange
Web application to push policy changes according to Cisco's IWAN deployment
In many manual IWAN deployments, there was no way other than CLI to push policy changes across the entire IWAN domain. 
This is a very small example where we are running an application on Flask that changes the preference for traffic across existing transports.
On the backend, we are using netmiko to connect to the domain master controller and execute the changes in CLI to reflect the policy

Disclaimer - This is a customized example for a lab environment, all the use cases and traffic classes have not been covered fully.
