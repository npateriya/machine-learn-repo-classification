Miggins Voting App
==================

Introduction
------------
This is an example voting app to be used as part of a number of demos, at the moment it is fairly simple and not yet been incorporated into full demos. The plan will be to show with solutions like

* Shipped
* Mantl
* Cloud Center
* Metacloud
* Traditional Application
* Mircoservice Application

At the moment it is based around Docker compose and I have been running and testing on Docker for Mac. I have all the files I have been working on here at the moment however I will start to tidy up once I have a working version I am happy with.

The purpose of the app is to present a page where uses can vote for their preferred pie flavour as well as providing an admin page to view the results. It will also provide details of the container that the app is running on.

Getting started
---------------

Download [Docker for Mac or Windows](https://www.docker.com).

Run in this directory:

    $ docker-compose up

The app will be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), and the results will be at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

Architecture
-----

![Architecture diagram](architecture.png)

* A Python webapp which lets you vote between two options
* A Redis queue which collects new votes
* A .NET worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A Postgres database backed by a Docker volume
* A Node.js webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time

Credit
------
I have to give credit to a number of different sources. Firstly I used as the base of my voting app something that [Docker created](https://github.com/docker/example-voting-app) and adapted a bootstrap theme called [freelancer](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-freelancer).
