# ggplot-pres
Presentation on ggplot for Cisco's Enterprise Data Science Office

The HTML document contains the presentation slides

The .Rmd document contains the code that generates the presentation, including all R code.

The presentation suppressed substantial portions of code in order to present the most important concepts. 

So many code chunks have eval=FALSE (present, do not evaluate) and others have echo=FALSE (evaluate, do not present)
