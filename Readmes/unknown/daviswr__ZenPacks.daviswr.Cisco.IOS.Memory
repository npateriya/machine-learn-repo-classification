# ZenPacks.daviswr.Cisco.IOS.Memory

ZenPack to model & monitor memory pools of a Cisco IOS device via CISCO-MEMORY-POOL-MIB

## Usage

This doesn't (yet) modify modeler plugins on any device class like /Network/Cisco, so it's up to you to apply the `daviswr.snmp.CiscoMemoryPool` modeler on the appropriate class or device.
