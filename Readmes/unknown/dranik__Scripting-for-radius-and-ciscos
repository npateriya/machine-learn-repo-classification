# Scripting-for-radius-and-ciscos

These scripts were done by me previously for a bigger project.
Scripts must be ran as a daemon. Hostnames differed itentionaly to avoid risk for initial contractor.

updater.py is made to update radiusd config and reset it on any config change. To work properly it needs users.constant file beside main users file. This file stores pre-configured user data.

cisco_whisperer.py updates routes on a certain cisco router corresponding to the data sent from server.

Both scripts are not usable without the data source.
Unfortunately this specifications cannot be shown on a public service due to my contract with the project owner.
