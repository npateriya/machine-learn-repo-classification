# Moto Wifi Hack

This is a work around for Moto X (2014) phones running lolipop.

Under certain conditions, Cisco wireless access points using PEAP will
not work with the moto x.

The symptom is that the wifi AP goes from "connecting" to "saved" but
never connects. This is due to an interoperability issue with the
cisco firmare and the PFM implementation on the phone.

Rather than provide a work around, Motorola insists that the world
should patch their networks. This is despite other models of phones
running lolipop being able to use these access points without issue.

This tool simply flips a 1 to a 0 in a text file and disables the feature.
