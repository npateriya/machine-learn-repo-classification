# COPC-API-Examples
Examples on how to interact with the Cisco OpenStack Private Cloud APIs (or any OpenStack for that matter)

* Command Line examples with the API
* Python examples with the API
* Ansible examples with the API
* Heat examples with the API
* Terraform example with the API

Most of these examples will just create an instance in OpenStack. 
They're just to show how you can do it and are code samples you 
can reuse in your own projects.
