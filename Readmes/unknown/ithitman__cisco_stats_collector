## Summary
Simple python script to collect stats from devices using SSH. Read from a database for the hostnames of the devices and parallel process multiple devices at the same time and display the results. Since the script is using SSH and paramiko you can actually use it for any device that supports SSH. 

## Install Instructions
### Overview
- We will install a database backend (postgres in this instruction).
- We will create a table that will house our devices and information regarding each device.
- We will edit some key variables that are required by script.

### Python Packages

`su dnf install python2 python-psycopg2 python-paramiko`

### Postgres Installation

This is a plain vanilla installation of postgres on fedora. Fine tuning postgres or installing it for other distributions is out of the scope for this document. Please consult appropriate manuals. 

`# su dnf install postgresql-server.x86_64 -y`

`# su postgresql-setup --initdb`

`# su systemctl start postgresql.service`

`# su systemctl enable postgresql.service`

### Table Creation

`# su postgres`

`# psql`

`postgres=# CREATE ROLE cisco WITH SUPERUSER LOGIN PASSWORD 'cisco';`

`postgres=# create table cisco_stats_collector (`<br />
`	ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,` <br />
`	hostname char(100),` <br />
`	username char(100),` <br />
`	password char(100),` <br />
`	comments char(1000)` <br />
`	);` <br />

### Inserting Devices into the Table

`psql -h localhost -U cisco postgres` 

This is just an example, put the appropriate router names, username and password. 

`postgres=# INSERT INTO cisco_stats_collector (hostname,username,password,comments) VALUES ('arwin-router-1','user','pass','Cisco Nexus 3548');`

If you have any issues connecting to the database make sure the permissions are correct in /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf and it should look like this.
```
local   all             all                                     trust
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
```
Again probably not the most secure but this should get you going. 

### Editing Script Variables
```
num_of_parallel_jobs = 10 # number of concurrent threads 
sql_username = 'cisco' # username to log into the database 
sql_password = 'cisco' # password to log into the database 
sql_database = 'postgres' # name of the database
sql_host = 'localhost' # location of the database
```

## Example

After you followed the install instructions this is how to execute the script. 

./cisco_stats_collector.py 

## Benchmark 

I have 6 devices in my database table. 
```
postgres=# select count(*) from cisco_stats_collector; 
 count 
-------
     6
(1 row)
```

* I set the variable 'num_of_parallel_jobs = 1' inside the script and the job took approximately 18 seconds to finish for 6 devices. 
* I set the variable 'num_of_parallel_jobs = 6' inside the script and the job took approximately 04 seconds to finish for 6 devices.
