# Cisco UCS M4 & M5 series Intel Processor Comparison Script

Notice: This script is work in progress, and a personal project for learning Python.  However, you're more than welcomed to contribute to it or use for your own project.

The idea of this script, is to provide a quick way to compare the baseline performance of Intel Xeon v4 processors on Cisco UCS M4 series platforms to Intel Xeon Scalable Family processors on Cisco UCS M5 series platforms.

In this first commit it gives the results of the SpecInt 2006, which benchmarks the performance of a CPU when performing one task -it is a measure of CPU processing speed.

As I work on this project, the idea is to also include the SpecInt 2006 Rate results, which benchmarks multi-threaded applications.
