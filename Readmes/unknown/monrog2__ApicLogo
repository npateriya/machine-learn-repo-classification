This is a greasemonkey/tampermonkey Script that allows the user to replace the Cisco logo in the upper left hand corner of the APIC GUI with an image of their choosing

To do so, please change the var "myLogo" image link within the script once downloaded. Specifically the following line:

//source location of desired image, please change this to the URL you wish you use

var myLogo = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4075138/head_icon_simple_3col.png";

After this, load the script like any other greasemonkey/tampermonkey script.
