# xmppautomater
GUI based application to automate inter-domain XMPP federation configuration between Cisco IM&P  servers.  

Wanted to automate the configuration end to end so that I can just click a button and watch the automation magic.
Don't think anyone else would need it but drop a email incase something is broken.
