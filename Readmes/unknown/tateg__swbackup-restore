# Switchport Backup & Restore Utility

This is a utility for backing up and restoring switchport configurations on Cisco Meraki MS switches.

This application was originally written using the Cloud 9 IDE on c9.io.  The application leverages the Meraki Dashboard API gem by jletizia.

Rails framework generated by c9.io.

OVERVIEW / NOTES:

-Most of the functionality takes place in the "index_controller.rb" file where the configuration is pulled from the switch and parsed into a YAML file for use later.

-Since there is no method currently for updating multiple switchports at one time, the singular method for updating a single switchport is used recursively.  Hopefully at some point in the future this may change.

-This needs to be cleaned up and moved off of Rails at some point.  It is not 100% necessary for this to even run on Rails in the first place because it is so light weight.
