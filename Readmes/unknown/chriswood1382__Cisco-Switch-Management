# Cisco-Switch-Management
Python Scripts used for cisco switch management


Basic python programs that I put together when trying to role out NAC on about 800 cisco switches. The problem was trying to figure out what devices were currently connected to each switch in order to determine if they could work properly with dot1x authentication or MAC address Bypass. 

I had never programmed with python before so I did most of this by trial and error and learned as I went. I am sure there could be much more efficient ways to handle the functions that I wrote but this ended up working great to review all devices that were connected to a switch stack or cluster.
