Welcome to the [Cisco DevNet](http://developer.cisco.com) Learning Lab for the [Cisco Open SDN Controller (COSC)](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/open-sdn-controller/index.html). The Cisco Open SDN Controller (COSC) is a commercial distribution of [OpenDaylight](http://http://www.opendaylight.org) that delivers business agility through automation of standards-based network infrastructure.

Built as a highly scalable software-defined networking (SDN) platform, the Open SDN Controller abstracts away the complexity of managing heterogeneous networks to improve service delivery and reduce operating costs.

With the Cisco Open SDN Controller, you can integrate business applications with the underlying network devices using Northbound Rest APIs.  The Rest APIs provide a list of supported base network functions, which are agnostic of the underlying network device manufacturer.

Developer support for COSC may be found in the [COSC community at DevNet.](https://communities.cisco.com/community/developer/networking/cisco-one/extensible-network-controller)

This learning lab consists of a growing body of code and [Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) collections for interacting with the controller. The controller itself, and this learning lab, are constantly evolving, so things break. Sorry about that in advance.

This learning lab is part of a series of such labs offered by Cisco's [DevNet](http://developer.cisco.com). More such labs are to be found at the [Learning Labs section of DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/learningLabs/overview.gsp). The code for this lab may be found in the [DevNet organisation in GitHub](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/cosc-learning-labs). 

When something does break, please tell us in the [COSC support community](https://communities.cisco.com/community/developer/networking/cisco-one/extensible-network-controller), or raise an [issue against this project](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/cosc-learning-labs/issues).

# How to Use the Lab
This lab requires a running instance of ODL or COSC which, in turn, require access to some form of network infrastructure. Cisco provides all of that either in the [DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/), or in [dCloud](http://dcloud.cisco.com). 

You can also use the [Virtual Internet Routing Laboratory(VIRL)](http://virl.cisco.com) technology to create virtual networks for yourself, and then use [XRv](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios_xr_sw/ios_xrv/install_config/b_xrvr_432_chapter_01.html#concept_99CB972CA2594877871B02EAF8D82B80) for [Netconf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NETCONF)/[Yang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YANG) based management. 

Finally, you can also use [Mininet](http://mininet.org/) to emulate OpenFlow devices (or buy such devices from Cisco, of course).

You can run the code [on your own machine](doc/guide/Learning-Lab/byod.md), or use the [DevNet Development VM](https://communities.cisco.com/community/developer/dev-vm) provided as part of the dCloud demo, on your machine, or running in a VIRL Technology Pack. See this [guide to using the code](src/README.md) for further details.

You can download the [open source version of ODL](http://www.opendaylight.org/software/downloads) and [run that](https://www.opendaylight.org/sites/opendaylight/files/bk-install-guide-20141002.pdf) on Mac OS X or Linux. If you are using Windows, try the the DevNet Development VM.

You will need to [register an account with Cisco](https://tools.cisco.com/IDREG/guestRegistration.do?exit_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.cisco.com%2Fsite%2Fdevnet%2Fhome%2Findex.gsp&locale=en_US) to be able to use either the DevNet Sandbox or dCloud. 

##DevNet Sandbox
The DevNet Sandbox contains physical (Nexus and Catalyst switches) and XRv devices that support OpenFlow and Netconf/Yang management scenarios, and is suitable for Interoperability Verification Testing (IVT), of the sort required to certify Cisco solutions.

## Cisco dCloud
The dCloud system contains a hosted demonstration deployment with virtual network devices supporting OpenFlow and Netconf/Yang management scenarios. If you do not have access to dCloud, please talk to your Cisco account manger or systems engineer, and they will be able to help you. See these [instructions for dCloud](doc/guide/Learning-Lab/1.md) for further details.
