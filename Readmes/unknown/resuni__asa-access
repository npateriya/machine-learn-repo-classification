# asa-access
Bash script to easily launch ASDM or serial console session with a Cisco ASA. 

## Requirements
This script requires the following to be installed:
- Java Runtime Environment (Required version of JRE depends on the version of ASDM installed on your ASA)
- IcedTea (icedtea-netx package in Debian, icedtea-web package in RHEL)
- screen

The following commands must be in your path:
- javaws
- screen

Unless you plan on using just the console, you must also be in a working X environment. 

When using the console, you will likely need root or sudo access.

## Usage

Synopsis:

`asa-access <IP ADDRESS>[:PORT NUMBER]`

`asa-access <HOST NAME>[:PORT NUMBER]`

`asa-access console`

Simply pass the IP address or host name as an argument to the script. The port number defaults to 443 if not specified. 

This script can also connect to the ASA's serial console. Simply pass the word "console" instead of an IP address. 

## Limitations
This is something I just hacked together, so there are a few things to be aware of. 
- The script assumes your console is at /dev/ttyUSB0. I might fix this later if it becomes a problem for me. If it becomes a problem for you, fix it yourself.
- Some distributions require root or sudo access to use /dev/ttyUSB0. If you can't get the console functionality to work, try putting sudo in front. 
- For obvious reasons, you cannot connect to an ASA with a hostname of "console". 
- I don't know why, but this script recently stopped working for me with Cisco ASA 5505's. Larger models still work.
