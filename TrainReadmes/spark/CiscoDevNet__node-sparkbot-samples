# Cisco Spark Bot examples in nodejs

Interested in creating your own Cisco Spark bots ? 

Go through the examples below.

If you feel inspired, follow the guides to run your own version of these bots: [Guide to run on Cloud9](docs/GuideToRunLocally.md) and [Guide to run locally](docs/GuideToRunOnCloud9.md).  

Or pick a [template](templates/) that suits your scenario, and customize it.

Note that these bot samples code leverage the [node-sparkbot](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/node-sparkbot) Bot framework.

__and if you're new to Cisco Spark Apps, note that DevNet provides 10 to 20' [Learning labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/labs).__
